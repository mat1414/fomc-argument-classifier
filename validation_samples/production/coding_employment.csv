CODE_Employment_0000,Our outlook for unemployment is worse than the Greenbook's because of firms' persistent caution in hiring full-time U.S. employees.,Unemployment outlook is worse than Greenbook forecast due to firms' persistent hiring caution,"A more pessimistic unemployment forecast than the baseline, caused by persistent hiring caution, supports maintaining accommodative policy to address weak employment conditions"
CODE_Employment_0001,"But still, I'm fairly optimistic. We are only at about 80 percent industrial capacity, and I think we still have a ways to go before we see that full employment unemployment rate pressure set in. I don't know how far that is because I have no idea what the full employment unemployment rate really is. But it's hard to match up 80 percent industrial capacity with 6.7 percent unemployment and say that we are there. It just doesn't look like it to me, compared to anything I have seen in the past.",Current unemployment rate of 6.7% with 80% capacity utilization suggests significant labor market slack remains before reaching full employment pressure,The assessment that significant slack remains in the labor market suggests monetary policy can remain accommodative without triggering wage-price pressures associated with full employment
CODE_Employment_0002,Labor shortages continue to be the main concern of virtually all businesses in the District. The unemployment rate for our five states dropped /2 percentage point in April to an average of 3.3 percent and remained near that level in May.,Labor markets are very tight with widespread shortages across businesses,"Extremely low unemployment at 3.3% and widespread labor shortages indicate an overheating labor market that creates inflationary wage pressures, supporting tighter monetary policy"
CODE_Employment_0003,"The Labor Department tells us that there are still 6 million people who are not working. Fortunately, they do not live in my District, but I would like to see a lot more of those people find jobs. Most of the metropolitan areas in my District have unemployment rates of around 4 percent or lower, and this has been the case for a couple of years.","Preference for more people to find employment, noting 6 million still unemployed",Explicit preference for lower unemployment supports accommodative policy to promote job creation
CODE_Employment_0004,"I think that the unemployment rate probably understates how weak labor markets are. The way I think about that is, suppose I told you the unemployment rate was 7.7 percent and asked you to guess, based on history, what part-time employment is, what labor force participation is, what wage growth is, et cetera. I think you would give stronger numbers than are actually the case.",Labor market conditions are weaker than the unemployment rate suggests,Assessment that labor market is weaker than headline unemployment rate indicates supports more aggressive accommodative policy to address hidden slack.
CODE_Employment_0005,"Labor compensation growth remains anemic. Indeed, my business contacts report no sign of labor cost pressures outside of health and unemployment insurance. The economy's substantial slack will continue to weigh on inflation, and the recent appreciation of the dollar should put some further downward pressure on prices.",Assessment of weak labor market conditions with anemic compensation growth,Weak labor compensation growth and substantial economic slack indicate continued need for accommodative policy to strengthen labor market conditions.
CODE_Employment_0006,"Overall, the attacks ensured that nearly every District state would experience the national recession. Many states had continued to expand well into the summer of last year, especially those without a large IT presence. But widespread employment losses in the District during the fourth quarter eliminated any advantages that states had accumulated from their delayed entry into the recession.",September 11 attacks caused employment losses to spread to all District states,The causal role of September 11 in spreading employment losses to previously resilient states indicates a significant negative shock requiring accommodative policy to support broad-based recovery
CODE_Employment_0007,"On unemployment, we continue to forecast steady improvement to 7.1 percent by the end of 2013 and 6.3 percent by the end of 2014.",Forecast of steady unemployment improvement to 7.1% by end-2013 and 6.3% by end-2014,"Gradual unemployment improvement suggests continued need for accommodation to support the recovery, though potentially allows for eventual policy normalization"
CODE_Employment_0008,"The rate of job growth also remains below the national rate, but it finally has been sufficient to bring the region back to its pre-recession employment levels.",Job growth has been sufficient to restore regional employment to pre-recession levels,Full employment recovery to pre-recession levels indicates economic strength and labor market tightness that typically supports a more restrictive monetary policy approach
CODE_Employment_0009,"At this point, the 12-month change in total compensation growth in the ECI has remained virtually unchanged at around 3 percent for five quarters. I would just remind you that standard economic theory suggests that both firms and workers going to the bargaining table ought to be concerned with and ought to be bargaining over total compensation, not wages and salaries alone.","Total compensation growth has remained stable despite wage fluctuations, reflecting standard bargaining theory","Points to stable total compensation growth as evidence that labor cost pressures may not be building, supporting a more accommodative policy stance"
CODE_Employment_0010,we're pushing down our unemployment rate projections slightly,Unemployment rate projections are being revised downward for 2018 and 2019,Lower projected unemployment rates indicate a tightening labor market that supports more restrictive monetary policy to maintain economic balance
CODE_Employment_0011,National economic activity is much stronger than earlier forecasts anticipated. Employment grew twice as fast as the labor force from January to October.,"Employment growth has significantly exceeded forecasts, indicating stronger than expected labor market conditions","Stronger than expected employment growth suggests the economy may be overheating and could lead to inflationary pressures, warranting tighter monetary policy"
CODE_Employment_0012,"Personal saving rates are estimated to be in the negative range, labor costs are rising, and labor demand remains very strong.",Strong labor demand and rising labor costs,"Very strong labor demand and rising labor costs indicate overheating in the labor market, supporting restrictive monetary policy to moderate demand pressures."
CODE_Employment_0013,"In light of the recent rebound in consumer spending, the ongoing recovery in the housing market, and the improvement in global financial and economic conditions, the odds seem reasonably good to me that overall activity will expand at a moderate pace in coming quarters, and if so, we should expect to see a pickup in employment growth relatively soon.",Expected pickup in employment growth based on improving economic conditions,Expected employment growth pickup would support eventual monetary policy tightening as conditions improve.
CODE_Employment_0014,"Well, at this point, inflation is running well below our 2 percent objective. So, in pushing aggregate demand to try to bring them back into the labor force and into jobs, it seems to me that we currently face no tradeoff in terms of our dual mandate.",Current conditions allow helping long-term unemployed without creating inflation tradeoff,"With inflation below target, stimulating demand to help long-term unemployed aligns with both employment and price stability objectives, strongly supporting continued accommodation."
CODE_Employment_0015,"This reference suggests that purchases will be zero at the time that the 7 percent level of unemployment is crossed. Given the recent behavior of unemployment, I see this as quite reckless for the Committee. Unemployment could easily cross 7 percent very soon, and we are currently, as a Committee, in no position to be at zero purchases that quickly.",Warning against ending asset purchases too quickly when unemployment reaches 7%,"Argues that ending accommodation too abruptly when unemployment reaches threshold levels would be premature and risky, supporting continued accommodative policy even as unemployment improves"
CODE_Employment_0016,"When we talk to business people about wage pressures, they give some indication that they're paying ""above normal"" to retain workers. But the definition of ""normal"" is moving higher. So we're continually seeing an increase in the so-called normal rate that gives me some pause.",Concerning upward drift in normal wage levels,"The speaker expresses concern about structural shifts in wage expectations, with tight labor markets causing an upward drift in what's considered normal wages, supporting restrictive policy to prevent wage-price spirals."
CODE_Employment_0017,"The view across my contacts more broadly was that labor markets were tightening throughout the employment spectrum, and there were a few more reports this time of increases in compensation: wage gains, bonuses, increased profit sharing, and more generous benefits.",Labor markets are tightening across the employment spectrum with increasing compensation,"Broad-based labor market tightening with rising compensation indicates building wage pressures that could fuel inflation, supporting the need for higher interest rates"
CODE_Employment_0018,"Weak wage growth and strong productivity growth in the third quarter combined to deflate unit labor costs at an annual rate of about 6 percent. We probably won't see anything like that kind of decline in the current quarter, but the Board staff is projecting a further small decline, and it could be larger than they have forecast. From my standpoint there is just no way to get around the fact that this kind of unit labor cost performance constitutes a moderate disinflation risk in the outlook, at least for now.",Weak wage growth contributes to disinflation risk through unit labor cost deflation,The speaker identifies weak wage growth as a key factor causing unit labor cost deflation and creating disinflation risk. This employment-related weakness in wage growth supports accommodative policy to prevent further disinflation and support stronger labor market conditions.
CODE_Employment_0019,"The resolution of fiscal uncertainty could unleash pent-up demand on the part of businesses and, possibly, households.",Resolving fiscal uncertainty could unleash pent-up demand for hiring,Potential for employment improvement if uncertainties resolve supports maintaining accommodative policy to help realize this upside potential.
CODE_Employment_0020,"Indeed, the bulk of the job cuts during the fourth quarter occurred outside the IT industry —in sectors such as transportation, retail trade, and travel-related services—and they were spread across District states.",Fourth quarter job cuts were concentrated outside IT industry and spread across multiple sectors,Widespread job losses across multiple sectors indicates broad-based economic weakness that supports accommodative monetary policy to stimulate recovery across the economy
CODE_Employment_0021,"Output growing at its potential rate, unemployment essentially unchanging, and inflation expected to hit 2 percent sounds like a steady state.",Characterization of current economic state as steady state with unemployment essentially unchanging,"Description of steady state with stable unemployment suggests no need for policy changes, supporting maintenance of current accommodative policy stance"
CODE_Employment_0022,"In the labor market, Friday's labor market report was better than expected, but conditions in the job market remain generally sluggish. The loss of UI benefits may be one reason for lower unemployment, as people are leaving the labor force. Hiring is still weak, as shown by the JOLTS data, and there is still some evidence of a shift in the Beveridge curve.",Current labor market conditions remain sluggish with weak hiring despite recent unemployment decline,Weak labor market conditions with sluggish hiring and labor force exit driving unemployment decline support continued monetary accommodation to stimulate employment growth.
CODE_Employment_0023,"There was also a lot of interesting discussion about wage growth, which most of you see as quite low with very little indication of acceleration. That seems consistent with substantial remaining slack",Low wage growth indicates substantial remaining labor market slack,"Weak wage growth signals that labor market slack remains substantial, justifying continued monetary accommodation to further reduce unemployment."
CODE_Employment_0024,"Even with that, growth was still a percentage point lower than potential and not strong enough to generate job growth.",Economic growth is insufficient to generate job growth,The relationship between below-potential growth and lack of job creation indicates need for more stimulative monetary policy
CODE_Employment_0025,You take some account of the positive incoming financial market data but recognize that they cannot mask the weak incomes and the slow trajectory for improvement in labor markets.,Current labor markets are weak with slow trajectory for improvement,The speaker's assessment of weak current labor market conditions with slow improvement supports maintaining accommodative monetary policy to help employment recovery.
CODE_Employment_0026,We heard for the most part continuing reluctance to hire permanent employees.,Firms show continuing reluctance to hire permanent employees,Reluctance to hire permanent employees indicates weak employment conditions that warrant accommodative policy to encourage job creation
CODE_Employment_0027,"The economy is operating far below maximum sustainable employment, and inflation is undesirably low—conditions that are likely to persist for several years.",Assessment that economy is operating far below maximum sustainable employment,"The large gap between current employment and maximum sustainable employment, expected to persist for years, strongly supports continued accommodative monetary policy."
CODE_Employment_0028,"Mr. Chairman, employment in the Twelfth District continued to contract in late November and December, as firms in nearly every sector and in most District states shed jobs.",Employment in the Twelfth District continued to contract broadly across sectors and states in late 2001,Continued employment contraction indicates economic weakness that supports maintaining or implementing accommodative monetary policy to stimulate economic recovery
CODE_Employment_0029,"And while the unemployment rate in May fell to 4.7 percent, this reduction reflected another large decline in labor force participation, as many of you noted. Indeed, the rise in labor force participation that we had seen since last summer has been largely reversed in the past two months. This development suggests that recovery along that dimension has been much more limited than I had thought.",Labor force participation decline suggests labor market recovery has been more limited than expected,Limited labor market recovery with declining participation suggests continued need for accommodative policy support.
CODE_Employment_0030,We've assumed a little more productivity growth and a lot less job creation in comparison to the Greenbook.,Forecast assumes less job creation compared to Greenbook baseline,Forecasting significantly less job creation than the baseline suggests weaker employment recovery that would warrant continued accommodative monetary policy
CODE_Employment_0031,"With economic growth being only modest to moderate, the unemployment rate will tick down over the next year or two.",Unemployment rate will decline only gradually over the next year or two due to modest economic growth,Forecast of slow unemployment improvement suggests continued need for accommodative monetary policy to support faster employment recovery
CODE_Employment_0032,"Earlier Greenbooks also had predicted that employment would finally begin to grow, and it has, if less robustly than we might have hoped.",Employment growth has begun but is disappointingly weak relative to expectations,"The speaker's disappointment with the pace of employment growth (""less robustly than we might have hoped"") suggests that current employment performance is below desired levels, supporting continued accommodative policy to strengthen job growth."
CODE_Employment_0033,"Prior to the attacks, District job losses generally were limited to the manufacturing and IT service sectors and were concentrated in IT-dependent geographic areas such as Phoenix, Portland, and the San Francisco Bay area. Following the attacks, job cuts were much more far-reaching, with employment in states and sectors that had been holding up earlier in the year contracting at a rapid pace.",September 11 attacks caused employment cuts to become more widespread beyond initial IT sector concentration,The causal impact of September 11 in broadening employment losses indicates a significant negative shock requiring accommodative policy response to support economic recovery
CODE_Employment_0034,"The prospect of subpar growth is likely to make the labor market recovery even more agonizingly slow that I previously expected. I now anticipate that the unemployment rate will end this year at about 9½ percent, declining only to 8½ percent at the end of 2011 and will take a couple of additional years to return to full employment.",Forecast of slow labor market recovery with unemployment remaining elevated for extended period,The forecast of persistently high unemployment and slow recovery suggests need for continued monetary accommodation to support employment recovery toward full employment levels.
CODE_Employment_0035,"The end of the extended unemployment compensation benefits at the end of last year essentially led to a significant expansion in the effective supply of labor, as people basically had to start really looking for work. This meant that the ability to hire someone at a given wage increased, as there was a larger effective pool of potential employees available.","Ending extended unemployment benefits expanded effective labor supply, explaining recent employment dynamics","This explanation suggests the labor market is less tight than it appears, reducing pressure for restrictive monetary policy"
CODE_Employment_0036,"The Seventh District economy continues to expand at a moderate pace, with tight labor markets increasingly being cited as a factor constraining growth.",Tight labor markets are constraining economic growth,"The speaker identifies tight labor markets as a constraint on growth, suggesting the economy may be overheating and requiring monetary policy tightening to restore balance."
CODE_Employment_0037,"A similar slowing was reported on the hiring front. For instance, Kelly and Manpower experienced softer demand for temporary workers, but again this was not characterized as a general pullback in hiring.",Current slowing in hiring activity based on district contacts,"The slowing in hiring and softer demand for temporary workers indicates labor market weakness, which reduces inflationary pressures and supports the case for lower interest rates to stimulate economic activity."
CODE_Employment_0038,"In light of the May payroll data and the downward revision to payrolls in April, the main question we will need to answer in July is whether recent data may be a result of the start of a significant slowdown in employment growth or, rather, reflect the month-to-month noise that is likely to appear in any macroeconomic time series.",Uncertainty about whether recent employment data represents significant slowdown versus temporary noise,This uncertainty about the nature of employment weakness suggests caution in monetary policy tightening until the situation becomes clearer
CODE_Employment_0039,"One of our directors, who for months reported that his large national retailing firm had not had to raise wages to get workers, has for the first time reported labor shortages and higher labor costs.",Labor shortages are beginning to drive up labor costs,The emergence of labor cost pressures due to shortages represents a shift toward wage inflation that would warrant restrictive monetary policy to prevent broader inflationary pressures
CODE_Employment_0040,"On that score, I'd emphasize that we're close to our full employment objective, that the underlying pace of inflation is not far from 2 percent, and that our best guess at the value of the equilibrium real federal funds rate is near but above zero.",Economy is close to the full employment objective,Being close to the full employment objective suggests that further accommodation may not be necessary and gradual normalization could be appropriate
CODE_Employment_0041,Household spending should be well supported over the near term by solid job gains and a saving rate that is higher than what one would expect on the basis of the level of net worth relative to income.,Solid job gains are supporting consumer spending in the near term,Strong employment supporting consumer spending indicates economic strength that could warrant tighter monetary policy
CODE_Employment_0042,"But there will be a great deal of discussion about them as well as about the bankruptcy or the ceasing of business by the implement dealers, the grain dealers, and others that have been very important to the Main Street merchant in these small agricultural towns. And the impact is going to be very great.",Expected significant negative employment impact from agricultural distress spreading to related businesses and small towns,Forecasted widespread business failures and employment losses in agricultural-dependent communities suggest need for accommodative policy to mitigate economic distress
CODE_Employment_0043,"In the business sector, businesses continued to see heightened uncertainty, which leads them to reduce investment and rely on part-time workers.",Business uncertainty leads to reduced investment and reliance on part-time workers,Uncertainty constraining business hiring and leading to part-time employment suggests need for accommodative policy to support full-time job creation.
CODE_Employment_0044,"Our view emphasizes a forecast that places real GDP growth at about 2 percent over the forecast horizon, with inflation also at about 2 percent. Unlike the Tealbook, we do not regard 2 percent real GDP growth as being meaningfully above trend. Consequently, we also expect relatively little change in the unemployment rate over the forecast horizon. We think end-of­ year unemployment rates will remain centered on 4.7 percent.",Forecast that unemployment rate will remain stable at 4.7% over the forecast horizon due to GDP growth being at trend rather than above trend,"Stable unemployment forecast suggests no labor market overheating that would require restrictive policy, supporting maintenance of current accommodative stance"
CODE_Employment_0045,"Weak real disposable incomes coming from weak labor markets and the problems that small businesses will no doubt confront in the next 18 months, as highlighted by Governor Kohn, suggest to me that we run the risk of more-persistent weakness on the income side than the upside improvements in balance sheets and household net worth.",Weak labor markets will persist for 18 months and cause weak disposable incomes,The forecast of persistent labor market weakness over 18 months and the causal link to weak incomes supports accommodative policy to address employment challenges and their economic consequences.
CODE_Employment_0046,"Now, you may plug in a negative productivity number. That's one way of reconciling it. Maybe the November and December employment data will get revised down. I guess that's another way of reconciling it.",Uncertainty about employment strength due to potential data revisions or productivity explanations,"The suggestion that employment strength might be overstated due to potential downward revisions implies less underlying economic strength than initially apparent, supporting a more cautious approach to policy tightening"
CODE_Employment_0047,"It suggests that maybe the unemployment rate overstates the tightness of the labor market by about ½ percentage point. In other words, if you could get U-6 down to where you'd expect it to be relative to U-3, you might get about ½ percent of additional hours worked. So it points in the right direction of saying that you have some extra labor market slack, but it's not a huge increment of slack, in my opinion.",Labor market has some additional slack but not a huge increment,"Finding limited remaining labor market slack suggests the economy is approaching full employment, supporting the case for less accommodative monetary policy"
CODE_Employment_0048,"Job growth has remained strong in Oregon and has picked up further from already high rates in Nevada, Utah, and Idaho, leaving those four states the fastest growing in the nation.",Strong job growth in western states indicates economic acceleration requiring policy response,"Strong job growth across multiple states suggests the economy is accelerating and may be overheating, supporting the need for tighter monetary policy to prevent inflationary pressures."
CODE_Employment_0049,"For most of 2005, however, it has seemed that the region might be gaining a bit—with employment growing at a pace only slightly behind that of the nation, signs of life in manufacturing, and strong residential real estate markets.","New England employment is growing at a pace only slightly behind the nation, showing modest regional improvement",Modest employment growth that still lags the nation suggests continued economic slack and room for accommodation to support stronger job creation
CODE_Employment_0050,"With oil prices hovering in the $12 range and not expected to pick up appreciably in the near future, consolidations and layoffs in the energy sector will likely continue for quite some time.",Expected continued layoffs in energy sector due to low oil prices,"Forecasted layoffs in the energy sector suggest employment weakness in this region, which would support more accommodative monetary policy to offset negative employment effects"
CODE_Employment_0051,"Data for California indicate that average hours worked per week in the manufacturing sector as a whole rose in December, hitting the highest level since 2000.",Manufacturing hours worked increased in December to highest level since 2000,"While this shows some improvement in employment conditions, it represents early signs of recovery that support maintaining current accommodative policy rather than tightening prematurely"
CODE_Employment_0052,The underlying narrative is that the effects of declining slack and disappointing productivity are more or less offsetting.,Belief that declining labor market slack and disappointing productivity are offsetting each other in wage determination,"The offsetting effects suggest that despite declining slack, wage pressures remain muted, supporting continued accommodative policy to allow further labor market healing without triggering excessive inflation."
CODE_Employment_0053,"First, with regard to our District, like President Hoenig's, our two Districts, I believe, are the only ones that had positive employment growth last year. In the Eleventh District, we created 192,400 jobs, according to our adjusted data, all in the private sector. That machine has stopped; in fact, we would have a straight line downward if we were to chart it.",The Eleventh District had strong employment growth in the previous year but this positive trend has completely stopped,The sharp reversal from strong job creation to declining employment indicates deteriorating labor market conditions that would support more accommodative monetary policy to stimulate economic activity and employment.
CODE_Employment_0054,"As Bill Wascher emphasized, long-term unemployment has now risen from its pre-recession level of about 1 percent to over 4 percent, and, as of May, 46 percent of the unemployed had been without a job for at least 27 weeks. This is an extremely disconcerting situation, one that translates into tremendous hardship for families and that has potentially serious adverse long- term consequences.",Assessment of severe long-term unemployment situation with adverse consequences,The severe deterioration in long-term unemployment and its serious consequences highlight the urgent need for accommodative policy to address employment problems.
CODE_Employment_0055,Retailers continue to describe consumers as worried about job security and cautious in their spending.,Job security concerns are affecting consumer spending,"Job insecurity is constraining consumer spending, creating a feedback loop that justifies accommodative policy to support both employment and economic growth"
CODE_Employment_0056,"we're at a very tight labor market, but we actually have plenty of manufacturing capacity... So there's a real asymmetry between the tightness of the labor market and the tightness of manufacturing capacity",Current labor market exhibits significant tightness despite slack in manufacturing capacity,Emphasis on labor market tightness as the binding constraint supports restrictive policy despite manufacturing slack
CODE_Employment_0057,"That pattern was reversed in the course of 1996, with employment growth slowing but the unemployment rate also falling. The latter fell to slightly below the national average, its lowest level in fifteen years.",Employment growth slowed but unemployment fell to 15-year lows in the district during 1996,"Unemployment at 15-year lows suggests very tight labor market conditions that could lead to wage pressures and inflation, supporting tighter monetary policy"
CODE_Employment_0058,"Although I do expect some slowing in growth next year, it would not be enough to prevent the economy from stretching beyond the full utilization of its resources.",Economy expected to operate beyond full employment capacity despite policy tightening,"The forecast that the economy will operate beyond full resource utilization implies employment will exceed sustainable levels, creating inflationary pressures that justify restrictive monetary policy."
CODE_Employment_0059,"My final 'if' concerned the relationship between faster compensation growth and product price inflation and whether we should automatically assume that the translation there will be one-for-one. The counter argument is that for the last several years product price increases have outstripped increases in unit labor costs and that has resulted in widening markups, unusually strong earnings growth, and a rise in the profit share.",Recent compensation growth may not translate to higher inflation due to widening profit margins,"Suggests that even if compensation growth increases, it may not lead to higher inflation because profit margins could absorb the cost increases, reducing the need for preemptive policy tightening"
CODE_Employment_0060,"What did we see? We saw payrolls growing rapidly relative to the underlying growth base. It sort of fits what we actually saw in terms of the economic data. In other words, some of the increase in job vacancies reflects an increase in demand responding to the increase in effective supply.",Rapid payroll growth reflects supply-driven rather than demand-driven labor market dynamics,Interpreting rapid payroll growth as supply-driven suggests less labor market tightness and wage pressure than demand-driven growth would imply
CODE_Employment_0061,"Domestic demand has not slowed appreciably, and wage and price data show some deterioration.",Wage pressures are deteriorating alongside other price pressures,Deteriorating wage and price data indicate building inflationary pressures that warrant restrictive monetary policy to maintain price stability
CODE_Employment_0062,"We often hear that worker scarcity is a problem, that employers can't find workers with the skills that they need. And then usually I turn around and ask them, ""Okay. Are you raising wages?"" ""No. We're not in a position to do that."" So I take these anecdotes with a grain of salt. Until we see them raising wages, I don't take much information from them.",Skepticism about labor shortage claims due to lack of corresponding wage increases,"Doubting true labor scarcity suggests the labor market is less tight than anecdotal reports indicate, implying room for further employment gains without inflationary pressure, supporting accommodative policy"
CODE_Employment_0063,"Beyond this, the demand for labor nationally appears to be outstripping the sustainable supply currently by a factor of maybe 2 or 3.",National labor demand is outstripping sustainable supply by a factor of 2 or 3,"Labor demand significantly exceeding sustainable supply indicates the economy is operating well above potential, creating substantial upside risks to inflation and warranting restrictive monetary policy."
CODE_Employment_0064,"I see several positives with respect to housing, including the relatively low level of housing starts relative to employment growth and the easing of lending standards for residential mortgages","Housing starts are relatively low compared to employment growth, indicating economic strength",Employment growth outpacing housing starts suggests robust labor market conditions that support economic expansion and potentially restrictive policy
CODE_Employment_0065,That rate of growth should also mean continued job creation at a pace that will materially reduce labor market slack.,Forecast that continued growth will generate job creation sufficient to materially reduce labor market slack,"Continued job creation that materially reduces slack suggests the economy is moving toward full employment, supporting the case for less accommodative monetary policy to prevent overheating."
CODE_Employment_0066,"We saw pretty dramatic numbers announced one day or two days ago, and I think that is intensifying, not lessening.",Employment cuts are intensifying rather than moderating,The intensification of job cuts indicates worsening employment conditions that would support more accommodative monetary policy to help arrest the deteriorating labor market situation.
CODE_Employment_0067,"Of course, indicators of business investment outside the energy sector had remained puzzlingly soft, but with firms still willing to expand their workforces, I was optimistic that capital spending would gradually pick up in response to stronger household spending and foreign growth.",Firms' willingness to expand workforces despite soft business investment suggests optimism for capital spending recovery,"Firms expanding workforces indicates economic strength and confidence, supporting the case for gradual policy tightening."
CODE_Employment_0068,We now have had three years during which economic growth has been faster than most people's estimate of potential and the unemployment rate has been below most people's estimate of NAIRU.,Unemployment has been below NAIRU estimates for three years,"Sustained unemployment below NAIRU estimates suggests the labor market has been operating beyond sustainable levels, which typically supports restrictive monetary policy to prevent inflationary pressures"
CODE_Employment_0069,"in view of the strength of the economy, the tightness of the labor market, and buoyant financial market conditions—the risk, to me, seems to be on the side of a more rapid pace of rate hikes than that",Tightness of labor market suggests risk of needing faster pace of rate increases,Labor market tightness is explicitly cited as supporting potentially faster rate increases than currently projected
CODE_Employment_0070,"Still, the main message is that the unemployment rate is about to move still further below NAIRU and as a result inflation pressures are likely to build over the forecast horizon.",Unemployment moving further below NAIRU will build inflation pressures,"Unemployment declining further below NAIRU will generate inflation pressures, indicating need for restrictive policy to prevent this outcome or address its consequences."
CODE_Employment_0071,The incoming data on consumer and business spending and the labor market also suggest the economy is firing on all cylinders and has plenty of momentum heading into this year.,Strong labor market data indicates the economy has significant momentum,"Strong labor market performance as part of broad economic strength suggests the economy may be overheating, warranting restrictive monetary policy to prevent excessive inflation"
CODE_Employment_0072,"There are labor shortages in a few sectors and a lack of qualified workers in some cases, but there is little evidence of wage pressures, broadly speaking.",Limited wage pressures despite some labor shortages indicate continued labor market slack,"Absence of broad wage pressures despite sectoral shortages suggests overall labor market slack remains, supporting continued accommodation."
CODE_Employment_0073,"Finally, the price data had come in about as I expected, consistent with my forecast that inflation would move up to 2 percent over the next two years or so, conditional on further labor market improvement, reasonably well-anchored inflation expectations, and roughly stable prices for oil and non-energy imports.",Labor market improvement is a key condition for inflation reaching the 2% target,Expected labor market improvement supporting inflation reaching target would justify gradual monetary policy tightening.
CODE_Employment_0074,"I don't think we are all that far away from it--as it would seem, from the 7 percent unemployment figure, we think that full employment is somewhere between 5.5 and 6 percent.","Full employment is estimated at 5.5-6% unemployment, with current unemployment at 7%","With unemployment only 1-1.5 percentage points above the full employment level, the economy is close to full employment, suggesting less need for accommodative policy."
CODE_Employment_0075,"Recent economic data, the seemingly stronger health of the labor markets, and the expected flattening out of oil prices are all good news.",Recent data shows stronger health of labor markets,"Stronger labor market health suggests the economy is improving and may have less need for accommodative policy, supporting a move toward more restrictive policy"
CODE_Employment_0076,"The Committee is going to be discussing enhancing forward guidance in March, it sounds like, because there's a good chance that we'll pass through the unemployment threshold in the very near future.",Unemployment rate will likely pass through the 6.5% threshold in the near future,Crossing the unemployment threshold would trigger reconsideration of forward guidance and potentially signal conditions are improving enough to consider less accommodative policy
CODE_Employment_0077,"While skills training capability is improving in the United States at high schools and at junior colleges, we believe it is not nearly keeping up with the need to retrain and train members of the workforce.",Skills training capacity insufficient to meet workforce retraining needs,"Inadequate skills training suggests structural unemployment challenges as technology displaces workers, potentially requiring accommodative policy to support employment during the transition."
CODE_Employment_0078,"Adjusting for the effects of the Verizon strike, payrolls increased only 73,000 in May, and the figures for March and April were marked down a total of 85,000. As a consequence, the average increase over the past three months, while admittedly somewhat better than the May figure, was just 125,000 per month, representing a marked and abrupt slowdown in employment growth whether measured relative to average monthly gains of 220,000 over the preceding three months or the 230,000 per month pace seen last year.",Employment growth showed marked and abrupt slowdown in spring 2016,Sharp employment slowdown indicates economic weakness that warrants accommodative monetary policy stance.
CODE_Employment_0079,"Expected growth is going to be sufficient to drive the unemployment rate, we believe, below 4 percent this year and well below that in the medium term... With the unemployment rate at 4.1 percent and with expectations of solid near-term real GDP growth, I think we're on a course that will take us well past full employment over the next year and in the medium term",National unemployment expected to fall well below 4 percent and past full employment,"Forecasting unemployment well below 4% and past full employment suggests potential overheating and inflationary pressures, warranting preemptive tightening of monetary policy"
CODE_Employment_0080,"The Bureau of Labor Statistics' announcement of a pending major upward revision in payroll employment means that the help that we thought we would get from productivity is much lower, causing an upward revision in the trend of labor costs.",Upward revisions to payroll employment reduce productivity gains and increase labor cost pressures,Higher labor costs due to employment data revisions create inflationary pressures that require restrictive monetary policy to contain.
CODE_Employment_0081,"Sixth, the rate of unemployment in our view is below the NAIRU, which we think is 6 percent, give or take 0.1. We could be wrong. Since unemployment is now below 6 percent and the CPI is rather well behaved, the question could be asked, is God kinder and has the NAIRU become lower? We don't think so.",Unemployment rate is currently below NAIRU of 6 percent,"With unemployment below the natural rate, inflationary pressures are likely to build, requiring tighter monetary policy to bring unemployment back toward its natural level."

CODE_Employment_0084,"With some slack remaining in the economy and with inflation below target, we need above-trend growth to continue the healing process.",Assessment that labor market slack remains and requires above-trend growth for continued healing,Remaining labor market slack justifies maintaining accommodative policy to support above-trend growth needed for continued labor market healing and progress toward full employment.
CODE_Employment_0085,"But when I looked at their employment numbers, the last four or five months of 1986 showed pretty quiet employment in manufacturing.",Manufacturing employment showed weakness in late 1986 despite export strength,Weak manufacturing employment suggests economic softness that could warrant accommodative monetary policy to support growth
CODE_Employment_0086,"I'd like to see further confirmation of employment growth, but business investment, consumer spending, homebuilding, and motor vehicle production all indicate that the first part of 2005 could be even a little stronger than we anticipate, assuming the November trade deficit was a bit of an anomaly.",Desires further confirmation of employment growth but sees positive economic outlook,"While wanting more employment confirmation, the overall positive economic outlook and expectation of stronger growth supports continued gradual policy normalization"
CODE_Employment_0087,"The biggest risk in my mind, though, remains the employment trend, which has been very sturdy relative to the pace of economic growth. If that trend stays intact over the next few months—I'm going to speak on the monetary policy part here—then I think the case for monetary policy liftoff will be quite compelling.",Continued sturdy employment trends would make a compelling case for monetary policy liftoff,Strong employment trends directly support the case for raising interest rates (policy liftoff)

The three-month averages of total and private payroll gains are now around 180,000 a month, whereas at the time of the February report, they were running around 130,000.",Payroll growth has accelerated significantly from earlier in the year,Accelerating job creation indicates strengthening labor market conditions that support reducing monetary accommodation.
CODE_Employment_0096,"Whatever the referendum decision on British membership in the EU, we will also have to appraise the recent weakening in payroll data.",Recent weakening in payroll data requires careful appraisal and suggests delaying interest rate increases,Weakening employment data creates uncertainty that argues for maintaining current accommodative policy stance rather than raising rates
CODE_Employment_0097,"In recent contacts with business executives and directors in the Eighth District, the consensus was that wage pressures are building, especially for unskilled workers and construction workers. I have been hearing these reports and have mentioned them here for some time, but I'm hearing more and more reports of actual increases in wages.",Wage pressures are building across different worker categories based on business contacts,"Widespread and intensifying wage pressures across worker categories indicate broad-based labor market tightness that could fuel inflation, supporting restrictive monetary policy"

In the one drawer he plans to cut 17,000 jobs, unannounced as yet; in a drawer to the right of that, a still higher number; and in a drawer to the right of that, a still higher number. I asked about the drawers to the left, and he said, ""There are none.""",Major employers are planning massive job cuts with no plans for hiring,"Massive planned job cuts with no offsetting hiring plans indicate severe employment deterioration ahead, strongly supporting accommodative monetary policy to mitigate the economic downturn and employment losses."

CODE_Employment_0106,"There are good reasons, I think, to expect inflation and expectations of inflation to remain well behaved over the next year or so, but they are all based on the variety of ways we have of assessing what is not directly observable, and that's the amount of slack in the economy. These measures are credible and reliable, but it's also wise to be cautious about how accurate they can be in an environment of expected solid growth. Excess capacity could be used faster than we expect, or we could be starting with less of it.",Caution about potentially underestimating capacity constraints and faster resource utilization,"Concern about potentially underestimating capacity constraints and the possibility of faster-than-expected resource utilization suggests risk of tighter labor markets, supporting less accommodative policy as a precautionary measure"
CODE_Employment_0107,"Second, the incoming data suggest a greater decline in housing and a somewhat weaker labor market.",Assessment that incoming data show a weaker labor market,The speaker's assessment of weaker labor market conditions from incoming data supports accommodative monetary policy to address economic softening and reduce the risk of further deterioration.
CODE_Employment_0108,"From these data, I conclude that, following the publication of the first estimate of 160,000 for the net payroll increase in April, we should have been more vigorous in explaining to the public that although that number was below our forecast and that of others, it was still adequate to prevent increases in unemployment, conditional on plausible behavior in the participation rate—though, of course, that is not the case for the May payroll data.","Mixed assessment of recent payroll data - April numbers were adequate to prevent unemployment increases, but May data more concerning","While April data was adequate, the concerning May data suggests a more cautious policy approach is warranted"

CODE_Employment_0117,"If we conclude that employment growth is slowing significantly, then, in order to judge whether we are at least maintaining the important progress we have made toward our full employment mandate, we will have to pay more attention to the number of additions to payrolls that are needed to maintain full employment. The answer depends on the trend in the labor force participation rate.","Need to assess payroll additions relative to full employment mandate, with the required level depending on labor force participation trends","Concern about maintaining progress toward the full employment mandate suggests a cautious approach to policy tightening, especially given the structural relationship with participation rates"

CODE_Employment_0122,A second possibility is that the reported slowdown in employment growth is real but reflects a lagged response on the part of firms to the weakness in aggregate spending seen late last year and this winter. Such a slowdown would arguably be consistent with the recent weakness in non-energy-related business investment.,Employment slowdown could reflect lagged response to earlier economic weakness,"Even if employment weakness reflects lagged effects, it still indicates current economic softness warranting policy caution."
CODE_Employment_0123,"To start off, I would consider setting the initial specification of that Taylor rule by calculating what NAIRU would have to be to make the current setting of the funds rate the Taylor rule prescription. The answer is that in the Taylor Rule with imposed coefficients, the NAIRU would have to be about 4½ percent. I think that is very much on the low side, but some might find it a plausible number.","NAIRU would need to be about 4½ percent to justify current policy, which is viewed as too low","The speaker's belief that a 4½ percent NAIRU is too low implies that current unemployment levels are below sustainable levels, supporting tighter monetary policy"

CODE_Employment_0125,"If you look at the growth of wages at this stage of the economic expansion and compare it to all other postwar periods, you will find that unit wage costs are relatively cheaper than they have ever been in the postwar period at this stage of the cycle. And I think that's one of the reasons why we are seeing a lot of substitution toward the employment side, despite some of the advantages to capital purchases [unintelligible], especially in the equipment area.","Unit wage costs are historically low for this stage of the economic cycle, driving substitution toward employment over capital investment","Historically low wage costs suggest the labor market is not overheating despite strong employment growth, supporting continued accommodative monetary policy without immediate inflationary pressure concerns"
CODE_Employment_0126,"They say that in the end the difference in labor costs is about $2.00 an hour, but when the labor cost is only 30 cents per $6.00 trash can, it is irrelevant. They say that labor could be free in Guangdong province and they still could not make such products there and import them at a profit.",Labor costs have become so small relative to productivity that location decisions are no longer driven by wage differentials,Structural shift where labor costs become irrelevant due to efficiency gains reduces wage-driven inflation risks
CODE_Employment_0127,"Second, our forecast generally called for a slowing to trend growth just around the corner, so we waited for the spontaneous slowdown rather than imposing a policy-induced slowdown. Of course, while we waited for the slowdown, continued above-trend growth kept pushing the unemployment rate lower until we ended up at a 4¼ percent unemployment rate.",Past accommodative policy allowed unemployment to fall to unsustainably low levels,The assessment that past accommodation was excessive and led to unsustainably low unemployment implies the need for more restrictive policy going forward
CODE_Employment_0128,"Well, one reason is, we might conclude—based in part on the higher rates of wage increase that we've seen recently and a core PCE price inflation rate that is at about 1.5 percent—that we are close to our targets, that the inflation rate is within close reach of 2 percent, and that we are already at very near full employment.",Assessment that the economy is currently near full employment,"Being near full employment suggests the economy may be approaching capacity constraints, which would support gradual policy normalization through rate increases"

CODE_Employment_0132,"I do not believe, therefore, that the decline in core inflation experienced over 1996 suggests that NAIRU is below the 5.4 percent average unemployment rate for the year. I suspect that NAIRU, at least for the near term, is near 5-1/2 percent.",NAIRU is estimated to be around 5.5 percent,"With NAIRU at 5.5% and current unemployment below this level, the economy is operating in inflationary territory, supporting restrictive policy to bring unemployment back toward NAIRU."
CODE_Employment_0133,"I, for one, would hope that what we're seeing in the early years of this century is not indicative of future female labor force participation. Maybe there is an economic reason for why that pattern of female participation is occurring, but I have yet to see one that really strikes me as reasonable.",Concern that declining female labor force participation in early 2000s may represent a problematic longer-term trend,"Declining female labor force participation would reduce labor supply and potentially create inflationary pressures, suggesting need for more restrictive policy to offset these supply-side constraints"

CODE_Employment_0141,"The responses indicated that, on average, about one-fourth of the tax savings is expected to go to capital spending, and about 15 percent to labor, so most is planned to be used to pay down debt, M&A, and returning funds to shareholders.",Corporate tax cuts are expected to provide additional stimulus to labor markets,"Tax cuts directing 15% of savings to labor will add fiscal stimulus to already tight labor markets, potentially exacerbating wage pressures and supporting the case for monetary tightening"
CODE_Employment_0142,"On that theory, I do think it's wise, for the time being, to look past the December employment report, the market turmoil, and other signs of weakness.",December employment report should be ignored due to data uncertainty and high standard errors in initial employment reports,"Suggests maintaining current accommodative policy by looking past weak employment data, which could otherwise signal need for more accommodation"
CODE_Employment_0143,"I thought President Rosengren also described interesting empirical work that suggests that a lot of individuals out of the labor market, including retirees, are likely to reenter the workforce as the expansion continues. And I think the bottom line of that—I'm not positive—is that there is more slack than what would be captured in U-3.",More labor market slack exists than captured by U-3 due to potential labor force reentry,"Hidden slack from potential labor force reentry suggests the labor market has more capacity than headline unemployment indicates, supporting continued accommodation."

CODE_Employment_0152,"I do worry a bit about the progress on productivity growth; that has been fairly discouraging. I may be wrong but, if you look at that closely, I think one of the major reasons behind that is obviously the employment growth. But you have to ask why we have gotten such a strong employment growth. A company doesn't just go out and hire because it's fun to hire. Obviously, the relative cost in this component of production is relatively cheaper.","Strong employment growth is occurring due to relatively cheap labor costs, contributing to disappointing productivity growth, but not indicating labor market overheating","The argument suggests employment growth is driven by cost considerations rather than demand pressures or overheating, indicating the economy can sustain current employment growth without immediate policy tightening"

CODE_Employment_0171,"The Texas economy continues to grow at a strong pace. We expect job growth to be approximately 3 percent in 2018, and the state's unemployment rate of 4 percent is near a multidecade low.",Strong job growth and low unemployment in Texas indicating tight labor market conditions,"Strong job growth and very low unemployment indicate a tight labor market that could generate inflationary pressures, supporting the need for higher interest rates to prevent overheating."
CODE_Employment_0172,"Let me just assure you that I intend, or at least I hope, to send that message in my press conference statement—that our expectation is, we remain on a gradual path that's not fixed. It's data dependent, but our expectation still is, over time, that some further increases will be appropriate if we do see the labor market on a solid path.",Future rate increases remain appropriate if labor market stays on solid path,A solid labor market path would justify continued gradual monetary policy tightening over time.
CODE_Employment_0173,"There are 70,000 manufacturing workers in northeast Ohio, and their average age is in excess of 50 years. One of the large firms, a steel company, put out a notice that it wanted to hire 100 entry-level production workers. They stopped taking applications after two days when they had received 1,500 applications for jobs with starting wages of $38,000. However, they could not find 100 qualified workers out of these 1,500 applicants. So, there is concern about the quality of the work force.",Tight labor market evidenced by high application rates but difficulty finding qualified workers,Tight labor market with skill mismatches suggests potential wage pressures as employers compete for qualified workers
CODE_Employment_0174,"There has been a pickup in demand for temporary industrial workers, according to my contacts at Manpower.

CODE_Employment_0179,"This has occurred about a year earlier than most forecasters had been expecting, so it is very good news for the region as a whole.",Employment recovery occurred a year earlier than forecasters expected,"Faster than expected employment recovery suggests stronger economic momentum than anticipated, which could warrant a more restrictive policy stance to prevent overheating"
CODE_Employment_0180,"After a year of exceptionally strong economic performance in 1997 and into 1998, the economy of the Dallas region has recently begun to show some signs of softening, or at least expectations and early hints of softening. Lower oil prices, the effects of the Asian crisis, and continued labor market tightness are key factors responsible for the spreading expectation of slower growth.",Current economic softening with labor market tightness contributing to slower growth expectations,"The identification of multiple factors causing slower growth expectations, including the effects of tight labor markets, suggests economic conditions that could warrant accommodative monetary policy to support growth."
CODE_Employment_0181,"Second, while jobs in Massachusetts declined in November and December and the rest of the region grew moderately, the unemployment rate fell to 4.3 percent, the lowest of all the census regions. The number of unemployed actually fell by 20 percent. This is because New England was also the only part of the nation to experience a decline in the size of its labor force over the past year. Workers either are leaving New England and migrating to other parts of the country or dropping out of the work force, or both. Again, this won't bode well as firms begin to look for people to hire on a broader scale than they may be doing now.",Concern about declining labor force and future hiring difficulties despite low unemployment,"Low unemployment combined with declining labor force suggests labor market tightness and potential hiring difficulties, indicating reduced slack that supports less accommodative monetary policy"

CODE_Employment_0191,"People essentially buy custom housing, which does not lend itself to improvements in homebuilding productivity. Indeed, the manufacturing component of home construction, even though it is rising, is held back to a remarkable extent by the idiosyncratic desire of homeowners not to have a house that looks like the next-door neighbor's. The result is very low productivity in construction.",Construction sector has structurally low productivity due to the custom nature of housing and consumer preferences,"Understanding structural productivity differences helps explain housing price dynamics through non-monetary factors, suggesting monetary policy need not respond to housing price increases driven by these structural factors"
CODE_Employment_0192,"So my policy preference for a given level or path of inflation would not be identical all the time. It would depend on what is happening in the real economy, just as in the first half of 2004 we tolerated rather rapid price growth on the basis of our calculation of the degree of excess capacity in the real economy and the temporary nature of the energy price increases.","Policy should be flexible based on real economy conditions, particularly when there is excess capacity","Supports accommodative policy when there is excess capacity in the real economy, suggesting employment slack justifies more accommodative monetary policy"
CODE_Employment_0193,"All of this is leading to some progress on employment.

CODE_Employment_0201,"It's difficult to pinpoint a distinct source for this growth, such as a few large employers bringing back workers. All indications are that, outside of manufacturing, it's quite broad based. The rise in employment is being reflected in improving state sales tax and income tax receipts.","Employment growth is broad-based across sectors outside of manufacturing, reflected in improving tax receipts","Broad-based employment growth indicates a healthy, sustainable recovery rather than sector-specific gains, supporting the case for less accommodative policy"
CODE_Employment_0202,They continue to temper greater optimism with a cautious approach to hiring and business spending.,Businesses continue to maintain a cautious approach to hiring despite some economic improvement,Cautious hiring behavior suggests weak labor market conditions that would support continued accommodative monetary policy to stimulate employment growth

CODE_Employment_0208,"Many contacts added that finding skilled workers remained difficult, as President Fisher mentioned.",Continued difficulty finding skilled workers despite overall hiring slowdown,"While this suggests some labor market tightness in skilled segments, it's presented in the context of overall labor market softening and doesn't appear to be worsening, thus not creating additional inflationary pressure that would require restrictive policy."
CODE_Employment_0209,"Other manufacturers also noted the challenges they are facing keeping up with demand. We have been hearing about many of these for some time, but they seem more pressing now: selective capacity constraints, difficulties ramping up the supply chain, and problems in moving product to market particularly due to the shortage of trucking capacity—drivers to drive the trucks.

CODE_Employment_0211,"We think that the steady-state value of unemployment is about 6 percent. The median value of U.S. unemployment over the post-war era is 5.8 percent, and the steady-state value is probably somewhat higher than that due to labor market damage associated with the financial crisis and its aftermath.",Steady-state unemployment estimated at 6% due to financial crisis damage,Higher structural unemployment due to crisis damage means monetary policy needs to remain more accommodative to achieve full employment than would have been necessary pre-crisis
CODE_Employment_0212,"By now, tight labor markets are obviously old news but, if anything, our sense is that they have tightened even further.",Labor markets in the Fifth District have tightened further beyond already tight conditions,"Increasingly tight labor markets suggest the economy is overheating and may generate inflationary pressures, warranting restrictive monetary policy to cool demand."
CODE_Employment_0213,"I also said then that even if growth slows to trend, there will remain an inflation risk from the prevailing low unemployment rate.",Low unemployment poses inflation risk even if growth slows to trend,"Current low unemployment creates inflation risk regardless of growth trajectory, suggesting need for restrictive policy to address labor market tightness."
CODE_Employment_0214,"The strong growth in the second half of last year certainly, as we all know, has narrowed the gap between actual and potential GDP and has brought unemployment down close to most estimates of the natural rate.",Assessment that unemployment has fallen close to most estimates of the natural rate,"Unemployment near the natural rate indicates the economy is approaching full employment, suggesting restrictive monetary policy may be needed to prevent overheating and inflationary pressures"
CODE_Employment_0215,So this looks to me a lot less like a case of cruising along and occasionally hitting a soft patch than a case of slogging through mud and once or twice hitting a stretch of dry pavement.,"The economic recovery has been persistently weak rather than solid with occasional soft patches, with growth significantly above trend in only 2 of 8 quarters since recovery began","The characterization of a persistently weak recovery suggests the economy needs continued monetary accommodation rather than policy tightening, as the recovery is not as self-sustaining as previously thought"
CODE_Employment_0216,"There were a number of points made about the weak aspects of the labor market, including potentially a slower matching process; the fact that ratios of job seekers to openings, at 4-to-1, remained very high; the fact that much of the decline in unemployment over the last year has been the result of people leaving the labor force rather than finding jobs; and the fact that involuntary part-time work remains high.",Labor market shows multiple structural weaknesses including slower matching process and high job seeker to opening ratios,"Multiple indicators of labor market weakness, including structural issues like slower matching, suggest need for continued monetary accommodation to address both cyclical and structural employment challenges"

CODE_Employment_0218,"Our labor markets continue to improve slowly and appear to be doing marginally better than those in the rest of the nation. Payroll employment in our three states increased in June for the fourth consecutive month. I don't want to overstate the strength; the increases have not been large, and employment levels are back only to where they were at the beginning of the recession.",Regional labor markets are improving slowly but remain weak,The slow pace of employment recovery and modest gains suggest continued need for monetary policy support to strengthen labor markets
CODE_Employment_0219,"This pattern suggests that the dominant narrative during the past year and a half of a recovery characterized by solid, if unspectacular, growth as the economy recovers from a serious recession may not be the best diagnosis of what has been going on. And if that's the case, there are obviously potential implications for policy.","The dominant narrative of solid economic recovery may be incorrect, with implications for monetary policy","Questioning the strength of the recovery narrative suggests policy may need to be more accommodative than currently assumed, as the economy may be weaker than the prevailing view suggests"
CODE_Employment_0220,"Employment in manufacturing is still soft, but the pace of layoffs appears to have slowed noticeably recently, including in the basic manufacturing belt in the Carolinas, where the problem has been centered in our District.",Manufacturing employment remains soft with slowing but continued weakness in the district,"The observation that manufacturing employment is ""still soft"" despite some improvement in layoff pace indicates continued labor market weakness that would warrant accommodative monetary policy to support employment recovery."
CODE_Employment_0221,But the risk of above-trend growth and the risk that the current unemployment rate is already below NAIRU together strongly support an asymmetric policy directive to complement an unchanged policy.,Current unemployment likely already below NAIRU with asymmetric policy risks,"Current unemployment potentially below NAIRU supports asymmetric policy directive biased toward tightening, indicating restrictive policy stance is appropriate."
CODE_Employment_0222,The problem I have is that I believe the initial conditions are such that we are already operating beyond the point of sustainability in labor markets.,Current labor market conditions are operating beyond the point of sustainability,The assessment that labor markets are operating beyond sustainable levels strongly supports restrictive monetary policy to address these unsustainable conditions

CODE_Employment_0232,"At the end of 1996, in December, the CPI inflation rate was 3.3 percent, and I think the latest reading is 2.2 percent. It has come down then on that trailing basis more than a full percentage point at a time when the unemployment rate has come down by half a dozen notches.",The staff model's sacrifice ratio appears inconsistent with recent experience where unemployment fell while inflation declined,Evidence that unemployment can fall while inflation declines challenges the traditional Phillips curve relationship and suggests less need for restrictive policy to control inflation

CODE_Employment_0235,"The basic result is that, following demandish-looking shocks, nominal wage growth and price inflation move together. So if we think that the economy is near the point of overheating because of overly-accommodative monetary policy, then we should see the rate of wage increases moving up contemporaneously with inflation. There's simply not much evidence of that at the moment.",No evidence of economic overheating based on wage-inflation dynamics from DSGE model analysis,Absence of overheating signals in wage-inflation dynamics indicates current policy is not overly accommodative and supports maintaining current stance

CODE_Employment_0239,"A third possibility is that firms may now be finding it very difficult to hire qualified workers, resulting in employment growth downshifting to a pace more in line with its sustainable long-run rate, as President Lacker suggested. Such a deceleration does have to occur at some point, as a stable unemployment rate probably requires average payroll gains to settle down at less than 100,000 per month in the longer run.","Sustainable long-run employment growth rate requires payroll gains of less than 100,000 per month","If employment growth has reached sustainable pace, there would be less need for further policy tightening."

CODE_Employment_0248,Wages continue to rise modestly at about a 2¼ percent rate. That's a long way from the benchmark of 3 to 4 percent implied by productivity growth and our inflation objective.,Wage growth remains well below the benchmark consistent with productivity growth and inflation objectives,Below-target wage growth indicates labor markets are not tight enough to warrant policy tightening and supports continued accommodation
CODE_Employment_0249,"Labor contacts tell us that labor negotiations in the construction industry are going to be tough this spring, meaning that they plan to catch up. The view in the unions is that the cost of benefits has been coming down in the last few years and that the contractors are adding to their incomes as a result. The workers feel that they now deserve larger wage increases in the next contract than they received in the last contract because of what they see as very substantial increases in productivity and efficiency in the construction trade.",Construction workers demanding wage catch-up due to perceived productivity gains and reduced benefit costs,"Anticipated tough labor negotiations and catch-up wage demands create upward pressure on wages, potentially leading to inflation"
CODE_Employment_0250,investment spending should continue to rise as businesses seek to economize on the ever-scarcer supply of labor,Investment spending will continue rising as businesses seek to economize on increasingly scarce labor supply,Scarce labor supply driving business investment suggests tight labor market conditions that support higher interest rates to prevent overheating
CODE_Employment_0251,"Increasingly, contacts are reporting that labor shortages are constraining business activity, either in the form of scaled-back expansion plans or business lost because of the inability to fully staff current activities. This is a widespread phenomenon in our District, with such reports coming from home builders and other construction firms, retailers, dining establishments, temporary help firms, and trucking firms just to name a few.",Labor shortages are constraining business activity across multiple sectors,"Widespread labor shortages causing businesses to scale back expansion or lose business indicates severe labor market tightness that could fuel wage and price pressures, supporting the case for monetary policy tightening."
CODE_Employment_0252,The slow expansion of employable labor apparently is constraining output growth.,Limited labor supply is constraining economic output growth,"Labor supply constraints limiting output growth suggest the economy is operating at capacity limits, which typically supports restrictive policy to prevent overheating and inflation"
CODE_Employment_0253,We expect the economy to remain above its high employment level through 1990.,National economy expected to remain above high employment level through 1990,"Economy operating above high employment level suggests tight labor markets that could generate wage and price pressures, supporting restrictive monetary policy to prevent overheating"

CODE_Employment_0256,"Labor markets continue to disappoint. While initial claims have dipped below 400,000 per week, they remain high enough to suggest that net job destruction is continuing.",National labor markets continue to disappoint with ongoing job destruction,Continuing net job destruction indicates labor market weakness that requires sustained accommodative monetary policy

CODE_Employment_0258,We had a big increase in employment in October. The increase was well above the average monthly increase for the first three quarters of the year.,October employment growth was significantly above the average for the first three quarters,"Accelerating employment growth in an already tight labor market suggests increasing economic momentum that could generate inflationary pressures, warranting restrictive policy."
CODE_Employment_0259,"Even businesses that are well run and well capitalized are doing, again, what any businesswoman or businessman would do under the circumstances. If they are in good shape, which are few, they are using this as a chance to cull out the kind of legacy middle management they have been waiting to get rid of for some time. Therefore, the bias is to lower head counts.","Well-capitalized businesses are using the downturn as an opportunity to cut employment, creating a systematic bias toward lower head counts",The systematic bias toward employment cuts even among healthy businesses suggests widespread job losses that would require accommodative monetary policy to counteract the pro-cyclical behavior and support employment recovery.
CODE_Employment_0260,"Our employment numbers in the finance, insurance, and real estate sectors in Massachusetts have grown almost 4 percent over the last year.","Strong employment growth in finance, insurance, and real estate sectors",Robust sectoral employment growth of 4 percent indicates economic strength and potential labor market tightness that supports a more restrictive monetary policy stance

A rather new development is that growth has slowed in California, with declines in manufacturing and construction employment noted in the last several months.",Employment declines in Arizona and California due to sectoral weaknesses,Regional employment weakness suggests economic softening that could warrant more accommodative monetary policy to support growth
CODE_Employment_0263,We spend a lot of time in Dallas thinking about where we could be wrong and where there could be more labor slack than we're seeing. We've had a lot of discussion about the millions of potential workers who are not in the workforce because of disability claims—as Governor Quarles mentioned—and we also talked a lot about the millions of workers who were previously incarcerated who have a labor force participation rate substantially below the U.S. average.,Potential hidden labor slack from disabled and previously incarcerated workers,"Recognition of potential hidden labor slack suggests the labor market may not be as tight as it appears, providing room for continued economic growth without immediate inflationary pressures, supporting more accommodative policy."

CODE_Employment_0267,"Employment is growing; it's just growing slowly. Unemployment is down, but that's largely because the labor force is down.",Employment is growing slowly and unemployment decline is primarily due to labor force shrinkage rather than job creation,Slow employment growth and unemployment improvement driven by labor force decline rather than job creation indicates underlying labor market weakness that would benefit from accommodative policy

CODE_Employment_0277,"Because it appears that inflation is likely to remain in check in the near term despite tight labor markets, there may be room to wait out some residual above trend growth, provided the forecast continues to point toward slower growth ahead.","Despite tight labor markets, inflation remains in check in the near term, allowing for accommodative wait-and-see approach","Tight labor markets are not immediately translating to inflation pressure, suggesting monetary policy can remain accommodative in the near term"
CODE_Employment_0278,"Is it conceivable that the length of the workweek may actually fall--so that we might get an even stronger rate of employment growth? It seems as though as an extreme point we might just envision that employers, though they have been very reluctant to hire workers, may do so if they believe that economic growth is going to continue, and they may actually try to shorten the workweek.",Speculation that employment growth could strengthen if workweek falls as employers become more willing to hire,"If employment growth strengthens naturally through workweek adjustments, this would reduce the need for accommodative monetary policy to stimulate job creation"
CODE_Employment_0279,"As I recall, the estimated four-quarter average growth in productivity for nonfinancial corporations shows an increase of 5.7 percent. The staff estimates that the second-quarter number by itself is 4.0 percent.",Recent productivity performance has been very strong with 5.7% four-quarter average growth and 4.0% in the second quarter,"Strong productivity growth allows the economy to expand without generating inflationary pressures, supporting accommodative monetary policy"

CODE_Employment_0284,"The corollary is that the unemployment rate is likely to remain in the 4½ to 5 percent range as long as we remain in the current regime.

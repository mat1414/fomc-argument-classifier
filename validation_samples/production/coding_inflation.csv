CODE_Inflation_0000,"It is also having effects that are helping to strengthen already robust U.S. domestic demand, helping to keep the inflation rate down, helping therefore to keep real wages up, and also helping to keep U.S. interest rates down.",Asian situation is helping to keep inflation rate down,"The speaker argues that the Asian crisis is currently providing disinflationary pressure, which would reduce the need for restrictive monetary policy to control inflation."
CODE_Inflation_0001,"but I remain puzzled by the disconnect between the signs that the economy is in the neighborhood of full employment and indications that the tentative progress we had seen on inflation has stalled. But despite the further reductions in slack, inflation continues to run well short of our objective.",Current inflation is stalled and running well short of the 2% objective despite signs of full employment,Current inflation shortfall despite full employment suggests need for continued accommodative policy to achieve the inflation target
CODE_Inflation_0002,"In my forecast, I see inflation rates that are roughly symmetric in the short run but tilted to the upside in the medium to longer term. Inflation is now running between 1 and 1½ percent measured year over year, which is very near my inflation objective.",Current inflation near objective with medium-term upside risks,Current inflation being near the objective with upside risks in the medium term argues against additional accommodation
CODE_Inflation_0003,"I continue to think that we are better off with a regime-based forecast, which can be interpreted as something close to a steady state, with real GDP growing at 2 percent, unemployment fluctuating between 4½ and 5 percent, and inflation close to 2 percent, and very little change in the necessary policy rate to support that.",Preferred steady-state regime with inflation close to 2% requiring minimal policy changes,"The speaker advocates for a steady-state view where inflation remains close to 2% with very little change in policy rates needed, suggesting a preference for maintaining current accommodative stance rather than aggressive tightening."
CODE_Inflation_0004,"The basic facts, though, are that commodity prices seem very tame. They're down about 10 percent since July. Not only has energy fallen a lot, but also food at home, for example, has risen at an annual rate of less than 1 percent in the last three months.","Commodity prices are tame and declining, with energy and food price pressures subsiding",Declining commodity prices reduce inflationary pressures and support continued accommodative monetary policy
CODE_Inflation_0005,"The recent uptick in core inflation probably reflects pass-through of cost pressures due to higher energy, commodities, and import prices. If so, the upturn is apt to be transitory, since now, just like last summer, underlying pressures on core inflation appear to remain subdued.",Recent core inflation reflects temporary cost pass-through,"Identifies inflation as cost-push rather than demand-pull, suggesting measured policy response rather than aggressive tightening"
CODE_Inflation_0006,"On the price side, while some factors--certainly one-time factors--are going to have the effect of tending to raise the CPI a bit in 1994, our estimates are that we're going to see some greater improvement in the CPI than is indicated in the Greenbook.",Speaker expects CPI improvement despite some temporary upward price factors in 1994,"Despite acknowledging temporary upward price pressures, the speaker expects overall CPI improvement, suggesting that underlying inflation trends are favorable and don't require restrictive monetary policy"
CODE_Inflation_0007,"Fourth, the effect on inflation expectations was relatively muted and mostly short-lived. It is true that five-year, five-year forward rates are slightly higher now than before the last meeting, but the increase does not appear to be outsized.",Assessment that recent QE had muted and manageable effects on inflation expectations,"Provides evidence that recent accommodative policies had acceptable effects on inflation expectations, supporting continuation of QE policies"
CODE_Inflation_0008,"The thing that struck me is that the real rate has increased as inflation has come down over the past year since we last held, and so real rates are actually tighter.","Observation that inflation has declined over the past year, causing real rates to become tighter","The observation that declining inflation has made real rates tighter suggests that monetary policy has become more restrictive than intended, warranting accommodative action (rate cuts) to restore appropriate policy stance."
CODE_Inflation_0009,"The recent lack of progress on inflation is troubling against the backdrop of five straight years of undershooting our target. As was stressed in the staff's memo on inflation last time, we can't dismiss the possibility that underlying trend inflation is running below our longer-run objective.",Five straight years of undershooting the inflation target is troubling and suggests possible structural issues,Persistent inflation undershooting and potential structural decline in trend inflation argues for accommodative policy to restore inflation to target
CODE_Inflation_0010,"Retailers in the District tell me that they expect consumers to hang back and wait until the bitter end for steeper discounts, and those discounts are going to inevitably rise as Christmas looms close. Consequently, retailers expect to turn over their inventories, but they anticipate having to give up some of the normal profit margins that they seek at this time of the year. Discounting is extremely intense.",Retailers expect intense discounting and margin compression,"Intense discounting and margin compression indicate deflationary pressures in retail sector, suggesting less need for restrictive monetary policy"
CODE_Inflation_0011,"I read some of the Federal Reserve research that President Lacker cited in a recent speech as saying that we should not be too quick to throw out the models and tools we're currently using to forecast inflation, most of which suggest a gradual return to target.",Support for current inflation forecasting models and tools that suggest gradual return to target,Confidence in existing forecasting models that predict inflation return to target supports relying on those forecasts for policy decisions favoring tightening.
CODE_Inflation_0012,"The long-run oil futures are up substantially over the last two years—by $5 a barrel or something like that. For all practical purposes, that part of it, looking forward, is now permanent and not just temporary.",Oil price increases are now permanent rather than temporary,"Permanent oil price increases represent a structural shift that raises the inflation baseline, warranting more restrictive monetary policy to prevent broader inflationary pressures."
CODE_Inflation_0013,Most council members attributed measured inflation's recent low levels to a variety of special factors. These include the dollar's recent appreciation and the deceleration of medical care costs as well as the continued methodological changes implemented by the BLS.,Recent low inflation attributed to temporary special factors including dollar appreciation and medical cost deceleration,"Attributing low inflation to temporary factors implies these disinflationary forces may fade, requiring preemptive policy tightening"
CODE_Inflation_0014,"Therefore, it seems to me that the risks we are confronting are in the process of shifting, mostly because the risks of a subpar or disappointing performance of the real economy have diminished but also because the inflation pressures have perhaps ticked up a notch.",Assessment that inflation risks have increased relative to economic growth risks,"The shift in risk balance toward higher inflation pressures suggests that monetary policy should be more focused on preventing inflation acceleration rather than supporting growth, favoring continued tightening."
CODE_Inflation_0015,"Moreover, there is no evidence that our actions caused inflation expectations elsewhere to become unmoored. If you look at the University of Michigan's most recent result, five-year forward expectations actually declined in the mid-October report from the September reading.",Evidence that inflation expectations remained well-anchored despite QE actions,"Provides empirical evidence that accommodative policies did not destabilize inflation expectations, supporting continued QE implementation"
CODE_Inflation_0016,"In terms of the core inflation measure, obviously the idea is to take out the price changes that are temporary. But a good part of what we take out—food and fuel prices—is not temporary anymore.",Food and fuel price increases previously considered temporary may now be more permanent,"If food and fuel price increases are permanent rather than temporary, core inflation measures may understate true inflationary pressures, suggesting need for more restrictive policy."
CODE_Inflation_0017,"When you look at the prices of services, utilities, taxes, insurance, that area, you really don't see much opportunity for the commodity side, the goods side, to come back because it is really a quite sharp increase that has taken place there.",Sharp increases in services sector prices are constraining demand for goods,"The speaker identifies current inflationary pressures in the services sector that are constraining economic activity, suggesting these price increases are problematic and may warrant monetary policy action to contain inflation."
CODE_Inflation_0018,"If there is any significant pressure on prices, we aren't hearing about it.",Current lack of price pressures based on business contacts,Absence of current price pressures suggests less immediate need for restrictive monetary policy to combat inflation
CODE_Inflation_0019,"On inflation, it was noted that inflation has decelerated recently, as the staff projected. Commodity prices have come down, and unit labor costs remain low. I would say that the risks to inflation—for those who spoke about them—in most cases were seen as balanced, but not for everyone.","Recent inflation has decelerated as projected, with commodity prices down and unit labor costs remaining low, creating balanced inflation risks","Recent inflation deceleration and low unit labor costs suggest limited inflationary pressures, supporting continued accommodative monetary policy"
CODE_Inflation_0020,"If one looks at the growth rates, the real growth rates appear to be roughly equal to or in some cases below the growth rate of potential. Why is there such small progress made in the inflation area? I think you mentioned health care, gasoline taxes, etc., but it seems to me as though it's surprisingly small progress.",Speaker expresses puzzlement that inflation progress is surprisingly small despite economic growth being at or below potential output growth,"The speaker suggests that current economic slack should be producing more disinflation than observed, implying that monetary policy could remain accommodative or that current conditions don't warrant tightening"
CODE_Inflation_0021,"The issue here is that, although I don't think that inflation expectations have gotten unhinged at this point—and I think that we can say that the phrase ""reasonably well contained"" is okay—there is a greater risk that they could get unhinged. Now, I want to be clear. I'm not talking about the 1970s. It's not ""That '70s Show."" I have not been particularly happy with Allan Meltzer's comments about a bunch of things. The issue here is not that inflation expectations would go to that kind of level, but it could be that inflation expectations go up to 2½ or maybe even a little higher and it would be costly to get that down.",Risk of inflation expectations becoming unhinged with costly consequences,"The risk of unhinged expectations and the high cost of bringing them back down suggests the need for careful, potentially more restrictive policy to maintain credibility."
CODE_Inflation_0022,"There's nothing much we can do about that, but I think in some sense we're back to square one or worse in terms of the public's concern about inflation.",Public inflation expectations have deteriorated significantly,Worsened inflation expectations require restrictive policy to reestablish credibility and anchor expectations
CODE_Inflation_0023,"Nevertheless, I do see signs that there is some buildup in price pressures.",Observation of building price pressures in the economy,"The identification of building price pressures suggests inflationary forces are emerging that may require preemptive monetary policy action to prevent acceleration, supporting continued rate increases."
CODE_Inflation_0024,"To be sure, some manufacturers have been hit hard by higher input costs, especially for natural gas. However, they are not finding it any easier to pass those costs on than before.","Manufacturers cannot pass through higher input costs, limiting inflationary pressure","The inability of manufacturers to pass through cost increases suggests weak pricing power and limited inflationary pressure, supporting accommodative policy"
CODE_Inflation_0025,And now I look at the forecast that we have for 1995 and this trend of inflation in the out years revising upward worries me.,Concern about upward trend in inflation forecasts over time,"The speaker expresses worry about the pattern of inflation forecasts being revised upward over time, suggesting concern about building inflationary pressures that would warrant tighter monetary policy."
CODE_Inflation_0026,"underlying inflation remains moderate, and the recovery should gain strength over time",Underlying inflation remains moderate despite headline increases,Moderate underlying inflation supports maintaining accommodative policy despite temporary headline inflation increases
CODE_Inflation_0027,"Indeed, nationwide data suggest that labor cost pressures appear quite restrained. For example, as David noted, last week's ECI data showed no sign of any acceleration in private compensation.",Labor cost pressures remain restrained,"Restrained labor costs reduce underlying inflationary pressures, supporting less aggressive monetary tightening"
CODE_Inflation_0028,"So over time, from 2016 out through, say, I don't know when exactly, maybe 2020—by then, they are fully gone in the baseline, and we go back to a 4 percent funds rate with 2 percent inflation. But in the years before that, the economy is where we want it to be, at full employment with 2 percent inflation.",Long-term path returns to 2 percent inflation with gradual policy normalization,Describes achieving 2% inflation target through gradual policy normalization over several years
CODE_Inflation_0029,"We have already gotten some relatively high numbers on the core CPI, for example, in the first couple of months of this year. If that continues, even if we were to move and certainly if we were not to move and let's say we were on the fence again at the next meeting, asymmetry would just be one additional piece of evidence as to the direction of our longer-term strategy and efforts.",Recent high core CPI readings warrant continued policy vigilance and asymmetric policy stance,"The speaker expresses concern about recent high core CPI readings and argues this supports an asymmetric policy stance toward tightening, indicating a preference for restrictive monetary policy to address inflation risks."
CODE_Inflation_0030,"I still think, and Mike Prell said the staff has this view as well, that the risk is on the upside in this projection. I have felt that all along and I feel it even more strongly now, especially with respect to inflation.","Inflation risk is on the upside, especially given current economic conditions",The speaker's belief that inflation risks are tilted to the upside suggests a need for more restrictive monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising above desired levels.
CODE_Inflation_0031,"In fact, while I believe that the risks are close to balanced, my own judgment is that the probability of a ½ point surprise on the upside is a bit higher than that of a ½ point surprise on the downside.",The probability of upside inflation surprises is higher than downside surprises,An asymmetric risk distribution favoring upside inflation surprises suggests the need for a more restrictive policy stance to guard against higher-than-expected inflation outcomes.
CODE_Inflation_0032,Staying with asymmetry toward tightening may in fact signal more fears about inflation than might be necessary.,Current inflation fears may be excessive given economic conditions,Belief that inflation fears are excessive supports moving away from tightening bias toward more neutral policy stance
CODE_Inflation_0033,"I still do anticipate that we'll see steady improvement in the labor market, and that inflation will move up toward our 2 percent objective, a scenario along the general lines of that laid out by the Chairman in his June press conference.",Forecast of inflation moving up toward 2 percent objective,Gradual improvement forecast supports maintaining current accommodative stance to help achieve the inflation target
CODE_Inflation_0034,Readings on overall and especially core inflation have been uncomfortably and unexpectedly high.,Current inflation readings are uncomfortably and unexpectedly high,Discomfort with high inflation readings suggests need for policy vigilance and potential tightening
CODE_Inflation_0035,"So although I actually was comfortable with the two changes that are incorporated here, like Betsy, I am attracted to Narayana's compromise, which is to say, ""other commodities have pushed up inflation in recent months,"" but then return to the ""in a context of price stability.""",Commodities have pushed up inflation in recent months but policy should maintain price stability context,"Acknowledges recent commodity-driven inflation while emphasizing the importance of maintaining a price stability framework, suggesting a balanced but still accommodative approach that doesn't overreact to temporary price pressures."
CODE_Inflation_0036,"I think it's because traded goods are traded and non-traded goods are not, and we're going to see $1 million houses and land in Wyoming go up in price. The check this time that the rest of the world is having on us is that it's going to restrain price pressures.",International trade constraints explain the absence of broad price pressures,"The explanation that international trade in goods constrains broad price pressures suggests that inflation will remain contained due to global competitive forces, supporting the view that monetary policy can remain accommodative without triggering widespread inflation."
CODE_Inflation_0037,The forces that threaten to raise inflation over the forecast horizon are the prospect of a dissipation of favorable supply shocks and the expected persistence of very tight labor markets.,Supply shock dissipation and tight labor markets will cause inflation to rise,"Identifies specific forces that will drive inflation higher, providing justification for preemptive policy tightening to counteract these inflationary pressures."
CODE_Inflation_0038,"Moreover, to the extent that these costs are being passed through to prices, they appear to provide only one-time boosts to the price level.",Cost pass-through provides only one-time price level boosts,"One-time price level effects don't create persistent inflation, suggesting measured rather than aggressive policy response"
CODE_Inflation_0039,"However, Philadelphia Fed staff analysis of the 178 PCE components shows that the amount of disinflation we have witnessed and the dispersion of low or negative inflation across categories are not atypical of past recessions.",Current disinflation is typical of past recessions,"If current disinflation is normal for recessions, this argues against extraordinary policy measures"
CODE_Inflation_0040,"Turning to the national picture, we do not have any serious disagreements with the Greenbook, although we still are slightly more optimistic on inflation.",Speaker expresses optimism about inflation outlook relative to the Greenbook forecast,The speaker's optimism about inflation (expecting it to be lower than the Greenbook forecast) suggests less need for restrictive monetary policy to contain inflation pressures
CODE_Inflation_0041,"Also, we don't see quite the improvement in the trade situation that the Greenbook implies and that translates into our forecast for inflation which we have rising somewhat faster than the Greenbook. In fact, we put the GNP deflator at 4.3 percent, which is about a half point higher than the staff expectations.",Forecast of inflation rising faster than staff expectations due to trade situation,The speaker's forecast of higher inflation than staff expectations (4.3% vs staff forecast) suggests need for tighter monetary policy to combat inflationary pressures
CODE_Inflation_0042,"In fact, even though I see that the risk at our current and expected policy setting is getting close to balance, as a good central banker I remain at least a bit more concerned about the potential for inflation to edge somewhat higher.",Concern that inflation could edge higher despite balanced risks,The speaker's greater concern about upside inflation risks supports maintaining a restrictive policy stance even when risks appear balanced
CODE_Inflation_0043,"I think the bond market people, who from the way they are behaving apparently are quite discouraged about the inflationary outlook, have concluded that money is freely available.",Bond markets are pessimistic about inflation outlook,Market pessimism about inflation suggests monetary policy needs to be more restrictive to convince markets that the Fed is serious about fighting inflation
CODE_Inflation_0044,"So when I look at inflation expectations, which I consider to be a key driver of inflation, I think that the evidence in the data is that we have had not a big increase but a slight increase in inflation expectations, on the order of about 10 basis points.",Inflation expectations have risen modestly by about 10 basis points,"Even a modest increase in inflation expectations is concerning given their importance for inflation dynamics, suggesting caution about further policy easing."
CODE_Inflation_0045,plans to raise prices are the highest since 1991.,Report of highest business pricing plans since 1991,This report of elevated business pricing intentions suggests building inflationary pressures in the economy that would support tighter monetary policy to contain them.
CODE_Inflation_0046,"We have two problems in terms of inflation expectations right now. One is the supply shock, which I think is having some effects on inflation expectations, and also the view—although I believe it's incorrect, I do think that there's a problem that this view is widely held outside, and President Plosser mentioned this—that we on the FOMC are focused only on growth and are not at all worried about inflation.",Supply shocks and communication problems are affecting inflation expectations,Current problems with inflation expectations from supply shocks and credibility concerns suggest the need for caution in easing policy to avoid further undermining inflation credibility.
CODE_Inflation_0047,"On the price side, the anecdotal news does not indicate any pronounced change, but I sense that, if anything, there is perhaps a little more inflationary pressure than was the case just a few months ago.",Sensing a little more inflationary pressure than a few months ago,Increasing inflationary pressure indicates potential need for tighter monetary policy to prevent further acceleration
CODE_Inflation_0048,"We are [now] accommodating an external shock from food and oil. It's no longer the view of the economics profession that external shocks should always be accommodated, but our policy is doing that.",Current policy inappropriately accommodates external food and oil shocks,"Argues against accommodating external shocks through monetary policy, supporting tighter policy stance"
CODE_Inflation_0049,"While I'm optimistic about inflation and I think it will decline over the next year and a half, the recent behavior of wage costs is certainly a concern.","Forecast of declining inflation over the next year and a half, with concerns about wage cost pressures","The expectation of declining inflation supports accommodative policy, though wage cost concerns suggest monitoring for upside risks"
CODE_Inflation_0050,"And as we know, we've always been below on our projections. I think we're now building inflation into the economy to a degree that we've never had it; consumer behavior shows that.",Inflation is becoming embedded in the economy to an unprecedented degree,Embedded inflation reflected in consumer behavior requires more aggressive monetary policy to break inflationary psychology
CODE_Inflation_0051,"The incoming data have been in line with my expectations for accelerating activity, further improvements in labor markets, and a gradual firming of inflation over time.",Forecast of gradual inflation firming over time based on current economic trajectory,Expected gradual firming of inflation supports the case for beginning monetary policy normalization and raising interest rates.
CODE_Inflation_0052,"We have all been citing producer price pressures in the last few months, and there are lots of good statistics to quote with respect to producer prices and also commodity prices.",Producer price and commodity price pressures are evident across multiple measures,Recognition of widespread producer price and commodity price pressures provides evidence of inflationary pressures that would support restrictive monetary policy to prevent further price increases.
CODE_Inflation_0053,I'm also taking signal from the fact that we've been unable to keep inflation sustainably at 2 percent despite ongoing improvements in labor markets and real GDP growth well above our estimates of its sustainable pace.,Unable to keep inflation sustainably at 2% despite strong economic conditions,Persistent inability to achieve 2% inflation despite strong conditions suggests need for more accommodative policy approach
CODE_Inflation_0054,I remain cautiously optimistic that the slowdown in growth and the uptick in inflation will both prove transitory.,Inflation uptick expected to be transitory,Expectation that inflation pressures will fade reduces urgency for aggressive policy tightening
CODE_Inflation_0055,Retail prices also appear to have edged down last month due to some heavy discounting.,Retail prices declined due to heavy discounting,Declining retail prices indicate disinflationary pressures that support easier monetary policy to stimulate demand
CODE_Inflation_0056,"Although businesses have had to absorb price increases for many of their commodity inputs, several business executives note that raw materials prices have stopped increasing for the most part and, in many instances, have started to decline.",Commodity prices have stabilized and begun declining,"Stabilizing and declining commodity prices reduce input cost pressures and inflationary forces, supporting less restrictive policy"
CODE_Inflation_0057,"We've been falling short of our inflation objective not just in the past year, but over a longer period as well, and standard monetary theory suggests that we shouldn't return fully to the neutral rate of interest until we're confident inflation is on track to achieve our target.",Should not return to neutral rate until confident inflation is on track to target,"Persistent inflation shortfall and monetary theory both argue against returning to neutral rates until inflation progress is clear, supporting continued accommodation"
CODE_Inflation_0058,"So I think what we have is very firmly anchored inflation expectations. We could see that long-term inflation expectations remained anchored in '07 and '08, when headline inflation was high and rising, and they have remained anchored in '09, when headline inflation has fallen to the lowest level in several generations.",Inflation expectations are firmly anchored across different economic conditions,Well-anchored inflation expectations provide the Fed flexibility to maintain accommodative policy without risking inflation expectations becoming unmoored
CODE_Inflation_0059,"In addition, if the neutral rate remains low relative to its historical value—a situation I expect—there's a high premium on guiding inflation back up to target so as to retain space to buffer against adverse shocks with conventional policy and to guard against slippage in expectations.",Low neutral rate creates high premium on guiding inflation back to target for policy space,"Low neutral rate environment makes achieving 2% inflation more critical for maintaining policy effectiveness, supporting accommodative policy to reach target"
CODE_Inflation_0060,"If the relationship is the same as the staff's, your kind of price [forecast] would have to produce about a 5 percent CPI.",Forecast that staff price projections would produce about 5 percent CPI inflation,"A 5% CPI inflation forecast suggests inflation is running above desirable levels, implying need for more restrictive policy"
CODE_Inflation_0061,"I believe, as do a number of others, that there is an increasing inflation risk emanating from labor market tightness, from the potential ending of some of the special factors that have restrained inflation recently, and from the stimulus that is emerging from financial markets.",Increasing inflation risk from multiple economic sources,"The speaker identifies multiple sources of emerging inflation pressure, which supports a more restrictive monetary policy stance to preemptively address these risks before they materialize in higher inflation."
CODE_Inflation_0062,"One of our directors, the CEO of a national baking company, says that food companies are facing rising prices and will have no choice but to raise prices in the near term. Retail sector firms also anticipate rising costs.",Business contacts report rising cost pressures across sectors,"Broad-based cost pressures across sectors suggest inflationary forces are building, arguing against additional monetary stimulus"
CODE_Inflation_0063,My confidence that inflation will move back to 2 percent in the medium term has been strengthened by the continuing tightening in the economy.,Increased confidence in medium-term inflation return to target due to economic tightening,Growing confidence that inflation will return to target due to economic tightening supports the case for policy normalization and moving away from accommodative policy.
CODE_Inflation_0064,"The one place where I think we are in agreement, if I understood the staff forecast correctly, is that we're likely to get wage pressures toward the end of this year and out into 1988 simply because we're operating probably at our potential in the economy at the moment. And if the inflation number that I have is right, that will in turn put some pressures on the wage front.",Expected wage pressures due to operating at potential with inflation feedback effects,The expectation of wage pressures from operating at potential and inflation feeding into wages suggests need for restrictive policy to prevent wage-price spiral
CODE_Inflation_0065,"Nevertheless, looking at these various pressures, it's a bit hard to escape the conclusion that most of the slack in labor and product markets is used up, and we are starting to see the effects on the price side. I think we are beyond the point of a preemptive strike.","Economic slack has been exhausted and price pressures are beginning to emerge, indicating the need for monetary tightening beyond preemptive measures","The speaker argues that reduced slack in labor and product markets is causing price increases to emerge, and that the Fed is past the point where preemptive tightening would be sufficient, implying more aggressive restrictive policy is needed."
CODE_Inflation_0066,"So at present, we face an inflation gap measured by core PCE that is modestly negative and an output gap that is modestly positive.",Current inflation gap is modestly negative,Negative inflation gap supports accommodative monetary policy to help close the gap and reach the inflation target
CODE_Inflation_0067,"Not surprisingly, we are even more pessimistic than the Greenbook about inflation.",More pessimistic inflation outlook than Board staff,A more pessimistic inflation forecast than the Board staff suggests greater concern about inflationary pressures and supports more restrictive policy.
CODE_Inflation_0068,"We are now the country with the most inflation among the major countries except Italy, I believe.",US has poor international ranking on inflation among major countries,Poor international inflation performance suggests US monetary policy needs to be tightened to match other countries' success
CODE_Inflation_0069,It appears that there has been somewhat more pass-through of import and commodity prices into the core measures than we anticipated,"Some pass-through from commodity prices to core inflation has occurred, raising near-term inflation concerns",Greater than expected pass-through to core inflation raises concerns that could warrant less accommodative policy
CODE_Inflation_0070,"So I think, then, that this flatter Phillips curve is likely to be persistent in our economy.",The flatter Phillips curve is likely to persist in the economy,Persistent Phillips curve flatness means policy must be more accommodative to achieve inflation objectives
CODE_Inflation_0071,"Raw materials costs are going up, with some squeeze on working capital in spite of the huge [amount of] liquidity that corporations have acquired.",Raw materials costs are rising and creating working capital pressures,"Rising raw materials costs represent cost-push inflationary pressures that are affecting corporate finances, suggesting the need for monetary policy to address these inflationary forces before they become more entrenched."
CODE_Inflation_0072,"Most do see PCE inflation as remaining at or below the 2 percent objective for the next couple of years, although, again, views varied somewhat.",PCE inflation expected to remain at or below 2% target for the next couple of years,Expectations of inflation remaining at or below target over the medium term support maintaining accommodative policy to achieve the inflation objective
CODE_Inflation_0073,"Hard evidence like consumer price pressures outside the energy sector is still scarce, but the continued increases in the PPI are worrisome.",PPI increases are worrisome despite limited consumer price evidence,Concern about PPI increases as a leading indicator of future consumer price inflation supports restrictive policy to prevent pipeline pressures from materializing.
CODE_Inflation_0074,"Therefore, looking ahead to next year, I see both headline and core inflation settling in at around 1½ percent","Inflation expected to settle around 1.5% next year, below 2% target",Below-target inflation forecast supports maintaining accommodative policy to help achieve inflation objectives
CODE_Inflation_0075,It does seem clear that the economy is likely to undergo a moderate recovery and that--also similar to the Greenbook forecast--we'll see modest gains with regard to inflation.,Expectation of modest inflation gains during moderate economic recovery,Modest inflation gains during recovery suggest current policy stance is appropriate and supports continued accommodation
CODE_Inflation_0076,"Prices are on the uptick as well. Almost all Beige Book contacts reported concerns about rising costs for metals, wood, plastic, rubber, fuel and other petroleum products as well as rising health care and other insurance costs.",Current rising price pressures across multiple input categories,Broad-based input cost increases suggest building inflationary pressures that may warrant less accommodative monetary policy to prevent these pressures from becoming entrenched.
CODE_Inflation_0077,My forecast--I'm obviously the bottom one among the governors-- is that we're going to have less real growth and somewhat more inflation.,Personal forecast expects somewhat more inflation than consensus,Forecasting higher inflation than other governors suggests need for more aggressive anti-inflationary policy to prevent inflation from exceeding expectations.
CODE_Inflation_0078,"It is now at the highest level since 1979, if my figures are right on that. And perhaps most importantly, I am impressed by the continued strength of business fixed investment, which is a forward-looking indicator, at least in some sense. So, again, I think the upside risk is still there and we should not lose sight of that.",Upside inflation risks remain significant given high capacity utilization levels,"The speaker warns about upside risks to the economic outlook, including inflation risks, given very high capacity utilization, which supports maintaining a restrictive monetary policy stance."
CODE_Inflation_0079,They also report higher prices for materials.,Reports of higher material prices indicating current inflationary pressures in manufacturing,"Rising material prices suggest inflationary pressures are building in the economy, which would support tighter monetary policy to prevent broader price increases"
CODE_Inflation_0080,Our models also have core PCE inflation holding between 1¾ and 2 percent and the fed funds target rate peaking at about 5 percent.,Forecast that core PCE inflation will hold between 1¾ and 2 percent,"The forecast suggests inflation will remain within the Fed's target range, supporting the projected fed funds rate peak of 5 percent, which implies continued restrictive policy"
CODE_Inflation_0081,"As our recent post-FOMC meeting statements have indicated, upside inflation risks also remain.",Upside inflation risks remain present,The presence of upside inflation risks suggests the need for continued vigilance and potentially restrictive monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising above target
CODE_Inflation_0082,"An implication would be a major swing in unit labor costs next year compared with this year, and presumably that might affect the inflation outlook.",Unit labor cost changes could significantly affect the inflation outlook for next year,"The speaker forecasts that major swings in unit labor costs will impact inflation, suggesting potential upward pressure on prices that would warrant more restrictive monetary policy."
CODE_Inflation_0083,"Although inflation has been sticky, by most measures—even measures of core inflation— it has come down over the past year. For example, core CPI inflation went from 2¼ to 1¾ in the four quarters ending in 2009:Q2.",Core inflation measures have declined over the past year,Declining core inflation trend supports maintaining accommodative policy as inflation is moving away from target rather than toward it
CODE_Inflation_0084,"But I quote Gary Stern's stern warning about the problems of identifying whether it is a blip or whether it is more incipient or creeping price increases, something that's likely to infect the CPI for the long term and in fact move on into the wage sector.",There are significant risks in misidentifying inflation as temporary when it could become persistent and spread to wages,"The speaker endorses concerns about inflation becoming entrenched and spreading to wages, suggesting the need for restrictive policy to prevent temporary price increases from becoming permanent inflationary pressures."
CODE_Inflation_0085,"The incoming data on inflation have tended to be disappointing this year, and I continue to concur with the staff's assessment that transitory factors largely account for the decline in both overall and core rates, while I also realize that this is far from certain.",Transitory factors largely account for recent inflation decline,"If inflation weakness is transitory, it suggests patience with accommodative policy rather than aggressive tightening"
CODE_Inflation_0086,The low overall CPI inflation during the period of supply shocks will be partly reversed as the supply shocks dissipate. That is an important part of the inflation story this year.,Low inflation will reverse as supply shocks dissipate,"Forecasts that current low inflation will reverse as favorable supply conditions end, providing justification for preemptive policy tightening."
CODE_Inflation_0087,I think it is very important that we send a message to the public that we are still committed to the fight against inflation. We have had that inflation this year and I think the markets need to know that we are not going to validate that.,Commitment to fighting inflation and not validating current year's inflation,The speaker's preference for demonstrating anti-inflation commitment and not validating current inflation supports restrictive monetary policy to maintain credibility
CODE_Inflation_0088,"Rather, my policy projection reflects the view that the headwinds afflicting the economy will continue to restrain economic growth even in 2016, so that a return to full employment and 2 percent inflation at that time is only attainable with the real funds rate remaining below its long-run equilibrium value.",Headwinds require low real rates to achieve 2 percent inflation target,Directly argues that achieving the 2% inflation target requires keeping real rates below equilibrium due to persistent headwinds
CODE_Inflation_0089,"As for inflation expectations, I do know that the Michigan survey has been fluctuating narrowly, and it is true that it's stable, but it's now in the lowest range ever recorded in the history of that survey, and the staff estimates of expected inflation drawn from the TIPS curve are also consistent with underlying PCE inflation below 2 percent.",Inflation expectations are at historically low levels,Historically low inflation expectations suggest no need for restrictive policy and support maintaining accommodative stance
CODE_Inflation_0090,"I think the underlying pressure here is for lower inflation with the weakness in compensation and labor costs, and I interpret that weakness as indicative of the fact that there is an output gap.",Weak labor compensation creates underlying pressure for lower inflation,Weak labor costs creating disinflationary pressure supports continued monetary accommodation to close the output gap
CODE_Inflation_0091,Seeing the inflation numbers play out this way should give us more confidence in our inflation forecast.,Increased confidence in inflation forecasts based on recent data validation,Greater confidence in inflation forecasts reduces uncertainty and supports proceeding with policy normalization.
CODE_Inflation_0092,"While I agree with the Greenbook pattern of modestly accelerating growth and decelerating inflation, I'd have to say I'm a bit more optimistic about the magnitudes in 1994. We're expecting that real growth will be up a bit more--not quite half a percent--with somewhat less inflation.","Speaker forecasts decelerating inflation in 1994, being more optimistic than the Greenbook projections",Expecting lower inflation than the Greenbook forecast suggests that inflationary pressures are not a concern and supports maintaining an accommodative monetary policy stance
CODE_Inflation_0093,"Indeed, as discussed at the past several meetings, the ongoing softness in inflation this year raises real concerns about its underlying trend.",Concerns about underlying inflation trend,Concerns about underlying inflation trend suggest need for continued accommodation to support price stability
CODE_Inflation_0094,"Also, most participants expect that inflation will be very close to 2 percent. But the median funds rate projection stands at 2 percent; that's 2 percentage points below the median estimate of its longer-run normal value.","Forecast that inflation will be very close to 2 percent by 2016, but this justifies keeping funds rate below normal levels","Despite expecting inflation near target, the speaker justifies keeping rates well below normal levels, supporting continued accommodation"
CODE_Inflation_0095,"More generally, however, most reports on prices still seem to point to little upward pressure or declines for a broad range of items such as aluminum, copper, paper, steel scrap, and steel mill products. The price component of the Chicago Purchasing Managers' survey for March continued on a downward trend and actually indicated declining rather than moderating increases in prices for the second straight month.",Broad-based weak price pressures across multiple sectors indicate little inflation risk,"The observation of weak price pressures across multiple sectors suggests low near-term inflation risk, supporting the case for maintaining accommodative monetary policy rather than tightening preemptively"
CODE_Inflation_0096,"The underlying trend in productivity is also solid, and, as I discussed at a previous meeting, I remain optimistic that it will remain so, in which case unit labor costs are likely to remain constrained.",Solid productivity trend will constrain unit labor costs,"Strong productivity growth helps contain inflationary pressures over time, reducing need for aggressive policy tightening"
CODE_Inflation_0097,I think inflationary expectations have increased substantially in the last quarter. The leading models have raised their projections of inflation for the next two years by about 1 percentage point.,Inflationary expectations have increased substantially in recent quarter,Rising inflationary expectations typically require tighter monetary policy to prevent them from becoming self-fulfilling
CODE_Inflation_0098,"It is sensible to acknowledge reality, and we should take out the word ""elevated"" so that we are not seen as inflation nutters. We should acknowledge that some of the numbers have come down but be careful about saying that we are done, we are happy, or we are satisfied.",Should acknowledge inflation numbers have improved but be careful not to declare complete success,"The preference for cautious communication about inflation progress, avoiding declarations of complete success, reflects a restrictive policy mindset that maintains vigilance against premature easing of anti-inflation efforts."
CODE_Inflation_0099,Although I'm not a proponent of the NAIRU way of thinking about the relationship between unemployment and expected pressure on inflation—a relationship that is hard to see in any recent empirical data—we do need to watch more carefully than ever for new bottlenecks and price pressures in a solid expansion that is now four years old.,Need to watch for bottlenecks and price pressures in a mature economic expansion,"The mature expansion creates risk of bottlenecks and price pressures, suggesting the need for careful monitoring and potentially restrictive policy to prevent overheating"
CODE_Inflation_0100,"As far as wage increases and price pressures are concerned, I would say there has been no pronounced change, but there are scattered indications that labor is getting a little more aggressive and wage increases in some instances are turning out to be a little higher than we were hearing earlier.",Scattered indications of more aggressive labor behavior and higher wage increases in the Ninth District,Emerging wage pressures suggest building inflationary momentum that may require monetary policy tightening to contain
CODE_Inflation_0101,"In investment demand, you're struck by the tremendous increase in construction costs.",Construction costs are experiencing tremendous increases,"The observation of tremendous construction cost increases indicates significant cost-push inflationary pressures in a key sector, which would typically call for restrictive monetary policy to prevent broader inflation from taking hold."
CODE_Inflation_0102,"Now, as I say in my public remarks, taken together, the evidence suggests to me that measures of expected inflation are at the very low end of a range that I myself consider to be consistent with price stability, at least in our 2 percent objective.",Current inflation expectations are at the low end of acceptable range for price stability,Inflation expectations at the low end of acceptable range suggest no need for tightening and support accommodative policy
CODE_Inflation_0103,"Looking at the national economy, we have no basic differences with the Greenbook forecast. There's a slight difference perhaps in unemployment, which we don't expect to rise quite as much, and our inflation forecast would be marginally higher.",Forecast of inflation running marginally higher than the Greenbook baseline,"A forecast of higher inflation than the staff baseline suggests greater inflationary pressures than anticipated, supporting a more restrictive monetary policy stance"
CODE_Inflation_0104,"As I mentioned, in the area of inflation we are a little higher than the Board staff. Although we are still predicting a fairly moderate inflation in the implicit price deflator for next year, I think this price level bears some closer monitoring.",Speaker forecasts higher inflation than Board staff and believes inflation requires closer monitoring,"The speaker's higher inflation forecast and call for closer monitoring suggests concern about inflation risks, which would support more restrictive monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising above desired levels."
CODE_Inflation_0105,"Monetary policy is becoming trickier, and there's no question but that the inflation concerns that a lot of people have raised are something that we are going to need to be watching carefully. But I don't think at this juncture, given what I heard to be most people's expectations that these effects would be transitory, that we want to do anything like beginning to move toward the exits.",Current inflation concerns require careful monitoring but are expected to be transitory,"Acknowledges inflation concerns but argues against policy tightening based on expectations that current inflationary effects are temporary, strongly supporting continued accommodative policy."
CODE_Inflation_0106,"My own information-gathering process during this intermeeting period leaves me very comfortable with the Greenbook baseline, which now expects more favorable paths for output, productivity, and inflation than it called for at our last meeting.",Endorsement of more favorable inflation path in baseline forecast,A more favorable inflation path forecast suggests less aggressive monetary tightening may be needed
CODE_Inflation_0107,"But the key to the inflation forecast is that the initial conditions--the very tight labor markets--would make it very difficult to avoid a significant increase in inflation without an adjustment to policy, even if the economy were to slow to trend immediately.",Policy adjustment needed to avoid significant inflation increase given tight labor markets,"Directly argues that policy adjustment (tightening) is necessary to avoid significant inflation increases, given tight labor market conditions."
CODE_Inflation_0108,"The constancy of long-run inflation expectations provides some reassurance, although I worry that if we had similar readings on such expectations in the early 1970s, they would have been slow to rise then as well, as bond markets had grown complacent about inflation.",Concern about inflation expectations becoming unanchored,Worry about expectations anchoring and historical precedent suggests need for policy vigilance to prevent inflation expectations from drifting higher
CODE_Inflation_0109,"It's still not clear to me that we've seen the full long-term adjustment by households and businesses to elevated energy prices. I continue to hear reports of more energy and other commodity cost pass-throughs that people would like to make, and reports of rollbacks of earlier energy surcharges are few and far between.",Incomplete adjustment to energy prices with ongoing pass-through effects creating inflationary pressures,Ongoing energy price pass-throughs represent a source of inflationary pressure that may require restrictive monetary policy to contain
CODE_Inflation_0110,they see recent price increases as a result of a confluence of a number of factors that are raising the level of prices rather than indications of a much higher inflation trend,Recent price increases reflect level shifts rather than persistent inflation trends,Distinguishing between one-time level effects and persistent trend changes supports not tightening policy in response to temporary price increases
CODE_Inflation_0111,"And they look forward to rent controls, so everybody is trying to get in [price increases] in advance of controls. So I think you're going to see a frightening--",Anticipation of frightening price developments as everyone tries to implement price increases before controls,The forecast of frightening price developments due to preemptive price increases suggests severe inflationary pressures requiring restrictive monetary policy intervention.
CODE_Inflation_0112,"If you go to a restaurant and you complain about what's happening to their prices, they say: Well, we're afraid of price controls. We hear more and more of this in conversations as we talk to business people; they're all very quietly trying to get their prices up just as rapidly as they can, which tends to accelerate.","Fear of price controls is causing businesses to accelerate price increases, which tends to accelerate inflation","The observation that businesses are accelerating price increases due to control fears, which accelerates inflation, indicates stronger inflationary pressures requiring restrictive monetary policy."
CODE_Inflation_0113,"Second, a tighter labor market is likely to translate soon into higher compensation trends. While I know that the linkage between wages and inflation is very tenuous, I still believe that pressure on resources does matter in terms of affecting the inflation outlook.",Tighter labor market will translate into higher compensation trends and affect inflation outlook through resource pressure,"The forecast of higher compensation from labor market tightness and belief that resource pressure affects inflation suggests upward pressure on prices, supporting a more restrictive monetary policy stance."
CODE_Inflation_0114,"But, again, if we in fact are settling into this 3 to 3-1/2 percent range, we can't be satisfied with that. So, we may still have some work ahead of us.",Inflation settling in 3-3.5% range would be unsatisfactory and require further policy action,Dissatisfaction with 3-3.5% inflation suggests willingness to implement restrictive policy to achieve lower inflation levels
CODE_Inflation_0115,"So again, I think that if we look at the risks we're facing, while we have to monitor all dimensions of the economy and of our objectives, inflation risks seem relatively low at this stage.",Inflation risks are relatively low compared to other economic risks,Assessment of relatively low inflation risks supports prioritizing employment objectives and maintaining accommodative policy
CODE_Inflation_0116,"Inflation is running below our 2 percent target, but incoming information is consistent with inflation gradually firming after low readings early in the year that reflected transitory idiosyncratic factors.",Current inflation is below target but expected to gradually firm toward 2 percent,"Assessment that inflation is currently below target supports maintaining accommodative policy, while expectation of gradual firming suggests patience rather than aggressive easing"
CODE_Inflation_0117,"But incoming inflation data could justify more aggressive action. Given the latest uncomfortably high readings on inflation, I think we have to remain vigilant.",High inflation readings require vigilance and could justify aggressive action,High inflation readings create discomfort and suggest potential need for more aggressive policy tightening
CODE_Inflation_0118,"I don't see much evidence that we are significantly beyond potential now, although I recognize that, with a very flat Phillips curve, it could be a long time before one figures that out.","Phillips curve is very flat, making it difficult to assess inflationary pressures from output gaps","Suggests limited inflationary pressure from current output levels and difficulty in detecting such pressures, supporting current policy stance"
CODE_Inflation_0119,"There is a lot of money and liquidity out there and that is going to be felt at some time. We have had a substantial depreciation of the dollar and there has been an increase in capacity utilization, and all these things ought to work to put some upward pressure on the dollar at some point.","Multiple factors will create upward pressure on inflation including excess liquidity, dollar depreciation, and increased capacity utilization","Identifying multiple inflationary pressures that will be ""felt at some time"" suggests the need for restrictive monetary policy to counteract these forces before they translate into higher inflation."
CODE_Inflation_0120,"As a result, I am a little more pessimistic than the staff about the inflation outlook in 2000 and beyond.",More pessimistic inflation outlook than staff forecast,Speaker's more pessimistic inflation forecast suggests greater need for policy tightening than what staff projections might imply.
CODE_Inflation_0121,"In that circumstance, it is likely to be consistent with damped inflation for the foreseeable future. I am a little surprised at how damped the decline in inflation and underlying inflation has been, but I also recognize that the relationship between the gap and inflation is not tight.",Forecast of damped inflation for the foreseeable future due to high unemployment and output gap,Expectation of continued low inflation supports maintaining accommodative monetary policy to address unemployment without inflation concerns
CODE_Inflation_0122,"All told, we expect to see GDP growth of about 2-1/2 percent this year, with some slight pickup in inflation over last year's levels.",Inflation expected to pick up slightly over last year's levels,Forecasting higher inflation supports the need for tighter monetary policy to prevent further acceleration
CODE_Inflation_0123,So far actual price increases continue to be subdued.,Current price increases remain subdued,"Current subdued price increases suggest inflation is not yet a pressing concern, potentially supporting continued accommodative policy."
CODE_Inflation_0124,"Despite the recent disappointing data flow, I have cut my modal outlook for real activity and inflation over the forecast horizon only slightly relative to my June SEP submission.",Downward revision to inflation outlook over forecast horizon,Lower inflation forecasts support maintaining accommodative policy to help achieve the inflation target
CODE_Inflation_0125,But I must say that I am getting increasingly concerned about the inflation situation. While we can always explain it away with special factors--grain prices or energy prices or whatever--it is always true that if we take out the most rapidly rising components we get something that we like better. I think we have to be very careful about pursuing that very far.,Increasing concern about inflation situation and warning against explaining it away with special factors,Growing concern about inflation and warning against dismissing it as temporary factors suggests need for more restrictive policy to address underlying inflationary pressures
CODE_Inflation_0126,"The economy has now reached my December 2014 projections in terms of inflation and unemployment, nearly six months earlier than anticipated in December, and it's projected to reach my December 2015 projections by the end of this year.",The economy has reached inflation projections much faster than anticipated,Faster than expected progress toward inflation goals demonstrates that the economy no longer needs the current level of accommodation and policy should be adjusted to reflect this progress.
CODE_Inflation_0127,"At the same time, we are also getting more frequent reports of increasing wages as a result of still very tight labor markets.",Wage pressures from tight labor markets creating inflationary potential,Tight labor markets causing wage increases suggest building inflationary pressures that may require restrictive monetary policy to contain.
CODE_Inflation_0128,"In my view, even with appropriate monetary policy action, the risk to the attainment of sustainable growth is unbalanced to the downside, while the risk to the attainment of price stability is unbalanced to the upside.",Upside risks to price stability objective,Assessment of upside risks to inflation suggests need for policy vigilance and potential tightening to maintain price stability
CODE_Inflation_0129,"Overall, I believe we should be in a vigilant posture, recognizing that the risks now seem to be tilted toward the upside.",Inflation risks are tilted to the upside requiring vigilant policy posture,The assessment that inflation risks are tilted upward supports a vigilant and potentially more restrictive monetary policy stance to address these emerging risks.
CODE_Inflation_0130,"And I don't think I'm really much more ahead than I was the last time in the sense that, while there is this anticipation of higher wages and a fear that it's going to happen, I'm not hearing that it actually has taken place.",Assessment that wage inflation pressures are anticipated but have not yet materialized,"The absence of actual wage increases despite expectations suggests current wage-driven inflation pressures are limited, which could support maintaining current policy rather than tightening"
CODE_Inflation_0131,"The lesson is, when inflation expectations are well anchored, the Phillips curve is flat. This suggests to me that we could have substantial output growth and a narrowing of the output gap without added inflation pressures.","When inflation expectations are anchored, the Phillips curve is flat, allowing growth without inflation pressure",Flat Phillips curve relationship means accommodative policy can support growth and employment without creating inflation risks
CODE_Inflation_0132,"First, with greater-than-expected slowdown in foreign economies, I expect the dollar to strengthen, and that will put downward pressure on prices in the United States.",Dollar strengthening from global slowdown will put downward pressure on US prices,Expected downward pressure on prices from dollar strength supports more accommodative policy to offset disinflationary forces
CODE_Inflation_0133,"It may come a little sooner than most people seem to think. Some of the pickup in industrial prices, as shown in the Greenbook and also reported in several of the District surveys contained in the Beige book, suggest that there may be a little more there than meets the eye. I hope not, but it is something that I think bears some watching for the time being.",Inflation pressures may emerge sooner than expected based on recent price data,"The concern that inflation may emerge sooner than consensus expects, combined with evidence of industrial price increases, suggests the need for preemptive restrictive policy action to prevent inflation from accelerating."
CODE_Inflation_0134,"Putting all of this together, I continue to believe that the risks of sustained deflation are low and do not require a policy response at this point.",Low deflation risks do not require policy response,Assessment that deflation risks are low directly argues against additional monetary accommodation
CODE_Inflation_0135,"The first sentence of the second paragraph of the Greenbook said ""the largest effects of the interest rate increases to date may yet lie ahead, but whether they will prove sufficient to prevent a buildup of inflationary pressures is unclear at this juncture."" I think that is exactly right; I agree with that 100 percent.",Agreement with assessment of uncertainty about whether current policy will prevent inflation buildup,The acknowledgment of uncertainty about inflation outlook and recognition that policy effects are still coming supports a wait-and-see approach rather than immediate further tightening
CODE_Inflation_0136,It's also important to remember that the revisions to PCE inflation are somewhat predictable. PCE inflation is usually revised up. Our last deflationary scare of the early 2000s was entirely revised away.,PCE inflation typically gets revised upward,"Expected upward revisions to inflation data suggest current low readings may overstate disinflationary pressures, arguing against accommodation"
CODE_Inflation_0137,"I think some of the numbers that have already been cited here recognize that we are seeing some show-through of price pressures even in the CPI, particularly in the last couple of months.",Recent data shows price pressures are manifesting in consumer price measures,Acknowledging that price pressures are showing through to consumer prices provides evidence supporting the need for restrictive monetary policy to address emerging inflation.
CODE_Inflation_0138,"I think the risks are clearly pointed to the upside given the tightness of domestic and foreign markets and the increase in headline inflation, which could feed through to inflation expectations.",Inflation risks are clearly pointed to the upside due to tight domestic and foreign markets,Emphasizes upside inflation risks requiring careful monitoring and potentially more restrictive policy stance
CODE_Inflation_0139,This further tightening of labor market conditions gives me some comfort that inflation will stabilize around our 2 percent objective over the next couple of years.,Labor market tightening will cause inflation to stabilize around 2%,Confidence that tight labor markets will drive inflation to target supports policy tightening
CODE_Inflation_0140,"In this regard, I take some signal from the incoming data on prices for September and October, which do suggest that inflation may be turning up, albeit just very, very gradually.",Recent data suggest inflation may be turning up gradually,Signs of inflation turning up support gradual policy tightening to prevent overheating
CODE_Inflation_0141,"But look what happened in the postal service; they increased prices, but revenue hasn't really gone up as they projected.","Price increases may face demand elasticity constraints, as shown by postal service experience","This suggests that demand elasticity may naturally limit firms' ability to pass through cost increases, implying that inflationary pressures may be somewhat self-limiting and potentially reducing the need for aggressive monetary tightening."
CODE_Inflation_0142,"Given that the economy is slowing, that energy price increases are showing some signs of unwinding, and that inflation expectations remain well anchored, inflation could ease some.","Inflation expected to ease due to economic slowing, unwinding energy prices, and anchored expectations",The forecast that multiple factors will cause inflation to ease provides strong justification for accommodative monetary policy to support the slowing economy
CODE_Inflation_0143,"As far as inflation is concerned, I do not expect a material acceleration in core measures of inflation this year.",Forecast that core inflation will not materially accelerate in the current year,"The expectation that core inflation will remain contained suggests that aggressive monetary tightening may not be necessary, supporting a more measured approach to policy normalization."
CODE_Inflation_0144,"This work also shows that the cyclical component of inflation, which should respond to the ongoing tightening, has been treading water for the past year or so.",Cyclical component of inflation has been stagnant despite ongoing monetary tightening,Lack of inflation response to tightening suggests policy may need to be more accommodative to achieve inflation goals
CODE_Inflation_0145,"We are meeting our criteria today in terms of inflation being near target and unemployment being near its longer-run level, so we should prepare to go ahead with balance sheet normalization.","Current inflation is near target, supporting balance sheet normalization","The speaker argues that since inflation is currently near target, this supports proceeding with balance sheet normalization, which would represent a form of monetary tightening by reducing accommodation."
CODE_Inflation_0146,Some manufacturers say that they are finally getting a little traction with price increases above and beyond the energy surcharges. But most manufacturers that I talked to report that competition remains very intense and they emphasize that they have little pricing power.,Manufacturers have limited pricing power due to intense competition,"Limited manufacturer pricing power suggests constrained ability to pass through cost increases, keeping inflation pressures contained"
CODE_Inflation_0147,"The news on inflation has generally not been good, even with the recent CPI numbers. But then, of course, they are reversed by the PPI numbers today.",Recent inflation data has been unfavorable,"Bad recent inflation news suggests upward pressure on prices, which would call for more restrictive monetary policy to contain inflation."
CODE_Inflation_0148,In our District inflationary pressures remain relatively subdued and may even have eased slightly since our last meeting.,Current inflationary pressures in the district are subdued and may be easing,Subdued and potentially easing inflationary pressures suggest there is room for monetary policy accommodation without risking excessive inflation
CODE_Inflation_0149,"If we don't succeed in bringing inflation down, then the predictable pattern is that after a mild dip we'll go into a renewed expansion starting from an inflation base of 8 to 10 percent, whereas last time we started at 5 percent.",Risk of next economic expansion starting from much higher inflation base,Need to prevent next expansion from starting at higher inflation base requires bringing inflation down now through tighter policy
CODE_Inflation_0150,"But it may be yet another early warning sign that inflation expectations cannot remain in check indefinitely in this current environment. In June, the prices-paid index in our business outlook survey of manufacturers rose to the highest level it has been since 1980.",Current environment may lead to unanchored inflation expectations as early warning sign,This warning about inflation expectations becoming unanchored suggests the need for policy action to maintain credibility and anchor expectations.
CODE_Inflation_0151,"If we have not yet overshot capacity, and I don't believe we have although one can't dismiss that hypothesis completely, the economy does not need to grow at 2 percent for two years in order to keep inflation from rising. If we have already overshot, then indeed we do need something like that.",Belief about capacity position and appropriate growth rate needed to prevent inflation from rising,The speaker's belief that capacity has not been overshot implies that restrictive policy to slow growth significantly may not be necessary to control inflation
CODE_Inflation_0152,"With respect to the national economy, I certainly agree that there are increased risks of more inflation than I expected earlier. We are going to get more inflation than I anticipated.",Increased risks of more inflation than previously expected,Higher inflation forecast than previously anticipated suggests need for more restrictive monetary policy to meet inflation objectives
CODE_Inflation_0153,"Given the sizable slack and the expected decline in inflation, the current very accommodative stance of monetary policy remains entirely appropriate",Expected decline in inflation supports very accommodative monetary policy,Explicitly links expected inflation decline to justification for maintaining very accommodative policy stance
CODE_Inflation_0154,I take all of this as positive evidence in suggesting that inflation should continue to firm.,Alternative inflation measures remain elevated and suggest continued firming,Forecast of continued inflation firming supports less accommodative policy stance
CODE_Inflation_0155,I have been somewhat encouraged that the past couple of inflation data reports have come in a bit stronger than what we saw earlier this year. My modal expectation is still that inflation will converge to target by the end of next year.,Recent inflation data showing improvement with expectation of convergence to target,Expectation that inflation will return to target supports the current path of policy tightening
CODE_Inflation_0156,"reasonable confidence that inflation will move back to our target of 2 percent over the medium term. In my view, those conditions have been met.","Assessment that reasonable confidence in inflation return to target has been achieved, meeting liftoff conditions",Direct assessment that inflation conditions for policy liftoff have been satisfied supports immediate monetary policy tightening.
CODE_Inflation_0157,"My sense is—and Nathan commented on this, and it was in the Greenbook as well—that globally inflation hasn't come down that much. This has been true for inflation-targeting countries and non-inflation-targeting countries.",Global inflation has not declined significantly across different monetary policy regimes,Observation that inflation remains sticky globally suggests domestic accommodative policy is unlikely to create significant inflation pressures
CODE_Inflation_0158,"While wage pressures remain elevated, price pressures of District firms continue to moderate, partly reflecting lower steel, copper, and shipping costs.",Price pressures from firms continue to moderate due to lower commodity costs,Moderating price pressures suggest less inflationary pressure and support for maintaining accommodative policy
CODE_Inflation_0159,"So I tend to agree with those who see a risk of an inflationary breakout, in modified terms, on the up side as a real danger.",Risk of inflationary breakout on the upside,The speaker's belief in upside inflation risks suggests monetary policy should be restrictive to prevent inflationary breakout
CODE_Inflation_0160,"But today, at least to me, there's simply no evidence of this risk in the wage data, in actual inflation, or in inflation expectations, and I'm projecting core PCE inflation of 1.8 percent for 2019.",Core PCE inflation projection of 1.8% for 2019 with no evidence of inflation risks,Below-target inflation projection and absence of inflation pressures support maintaining accommodative monetary policy rather than tightening
CODE_Inflation_0161,"Even so, core CPI inflation accelerates markedly by 2001 to a level that on a methodologically consistent basis would be the worst since 1995.",Core CPI inflation forecast to accelerate markedly by 2001,Forecast of significant inflation acceleration to concerning levels supports preemptive restrictive monetary policy to prevent this outcome.
CODE_Inflation_0162,"It does make a difference whether the rate of inflation was 10 percent or 13 percent over the last three months, even if we give it the usual Federal Reserve discount.",Inflation measurement differences of 10% vs 13% are significant for policy decisions,"Higher inflation readings should be taken more seriously in policy decisions, suggesting need for tighter monetary policy response"
CODE_Inflation_0163,And I think it will be very difficult to raise wages or prices by very much in such a competitive environment. There won't be any pricing power for a number of years under the most likely scenario.,Competitive environment will prevent pricing power for several years,"Extended period without pricing power suggests inflation will remain subdued, supporting accommodative policy for an extended period"
CODE_Inflation_0164,"Moreover, as President Mester also pointed out, some measures of consumer inflation expectations have moved higher recently. For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Survey of Consumer Expectations has shown a clear uptick in expected inflation at the one-year and three-year time horizons in recent months.",Some measures of consumer inflation expectations have moved higher recently,"Rising inflation expectations in some measures suggests that expectations are not uniformly declining and may be moving in a direction consistent with the Fed's target, supporting less need for accommodation."
CODE_Inflation_0165,"However, a sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated.",Sustained moderation in inflation pressures has not yet been convincingly demonstrated,Suggests continued vigilance and potentially restrictive policy stance until clear evidence of sustained inflation moderation emerges
CODE_Inflation_0166,I was curious how all that turns out because it's pretty evident that the ten-year TIPS compensation is giving us a quite significantly different reading. And it would be useful to know whether or not it's merely a statistical issue—with one based on core inflation and the other based on the total CPI—or if there's something more deep-seated there.,Discrepancy between TIPS compensation and other inflation measures creates uncertainty about true inflation pressures,"The uncertainty about which inflation measure to trust suggests a cautious approach to policy, and given that TIPS compensation appears to be showing higher inflation expectations than other measures, this would lean toward more restrictive policy."
CODE_Inflation_0167,"Our bet as well as the Greenbook's is that the economy will generate enough steam on its own to realize, after what has happened over the past three years, a very favorable trend... the basic trajectory of the data—solid growth, stronger labor markets, a slowly declining output gap, and flattening price increases—is the same.",Forecast of flattening price increases in economic trajectory,"The forecast of flattening (rather than declining) price increases as part of the economic recovery trajectory suggests inflation stabilization, which in the context of a closing output gap supports gradual policy normalization."
CODE_Inflation_0168,"Given the monetary assumptions that we adopted in July, we already have the velocity to a point that if there's any increase in inflation over what the staff is forecasting, real growth could shoot down to the point where it is negative all year long.",Risk of inflation increase above forecast could cause year-long negative real growth,"This suggests current monetary policy stance is already tight enough that any inflation surprise could cause severe recession, arguing against further tightening and potentially for some accommodation."
CODE_Inflation_0169,"As I talked about extensively yesterday, there are good reasons to believe inflation will not move quickly back to target.",There are good reasons to believe inflation will not move quickly back to target,"Expectation that inflation will be slow to return to target suggests need for patient, accommodative monetary policy"
CODE_Inflation_0170,"The unemployment rate has continued to fall more rapidly than expected, and inflation has remained below the 2 percent objective.",Current inflation remains below the 2% target,Below-target inflation suggests continued need for accommodative monetary policy to support price stability objective
CODE_Inflation_0171,The second issue is why there are no price pressures in spite of boom conditions.,Current absence of price pressures despite boom economic conditions,"The observation that price pressures are currently absent despite strong economic conditions suggests that inflation is not an immediate concern, which could support maintaining accommodative policy in the near term."
CODE_Inflation_0172,"At our currently high resource utilization rates, this strength threatens to generate noticeable price pressures over the forecast horizon.",High resource utilization threatens to generate price pressures,Warning about price pressure risks from high resource utilization supports tighter monetary policy to cool economic conditions
CODE_Inflation_0173,"I expect inflation will gradually approach the Committee's objective, actually, by the end of this year.",Inflation will gradually approach the Committee's 2% objective by the end of 2014,"If inflation is expected to reach the target by year-end, this reduces the need for continued monetary accommodation and supports beginning policy normalization."
CODE_Inflation_0174,This was based on a model using 5 percent money growth. What that shows in 1988 is what I would call a reasonable economic performance on a longer-term basis--in the 2 to 2-1/2 percent area real [GNP]--and maybe 4 to 4-1/2 percent in prices.,Model-based forecast that 5% money growth leads to 4-4.5% price inflation,The forecast that current monetary policy settings would lead to 4-4.5% inflation suggests this level may be too high and supports more restrictive policy to achieve lower inflation.
CODE_Inflation_0175,"The new language in paragraph 1 plays down the recent increases in inflation because they are not as apparent in the core PCE inflation measure. This almost seems to suggest that inflation is not moving toward target, but that we are nevertheless planning a series of aggressive rate increases.","Core PCE inflation increases are not as apparent, questioning aggressive rate increases","The speaker expresses concern about planning aggressive rate increases when core inflation measures don't show strong movement toward target, suggesting this inconsistency argues against restrictive policy moves."
CODE_Inflation_0176,"I also agree with Governor Kohn that we are in a reasonably good spot with moderate growth likely going forward and inflation and inflation expectations reasonably contained. It is reasonable to think that they may be going down, but there's a lot of uncertainty, and most of the uncertainty is to the upside.","Inflation and expectations are reasonably contained and may decline, but most uncertainty is to the upside","While acknowledging current contained inflation, the emphasis on upside uncertainty suggests a risk management approach that would favor maintaining restrictive vigilance to guard against potential inflation increases."
CODE_Inflation_0177,And I expect that this situation is going to cause us to adopt wage and price controls sometime this year or next year. people are sufficiently excited about the inflation and sufficiently disenchanted with the actions in the fiscal and monetary fields.,Current inflation situation will likely lead to wage and price controls,Risk of wage-price controls due to inadequate monetary and fiscal policy suggests need for more aggressive monetary tightening
CODE_Inflation_0178,"So far, regional manufacturers have not been raising the prices of their own outputs, but the October survey did show that many of them are now anticipating that they will raise prices over the next six months; that is, future prices will go up.",Manufacturers anticipate raising prices over the next six months,"Expected near-term price increases suggest inflationary pressures are building, arguing against additional accommodation"
CODE_Inflation_0179,"That should have a favorable effect on the inflation outlook and also its own slowing effect in the economy, and I think that will be a very important part of our discussion going forward.",Belief that tighter real rates will have favorable effects on the inflation outlook,The view that current tighter real rates will keep inflation well-behaved provides confidence that accommodative policy moves can be made without jeopardizing price stability objectives.
CODE_Inflation_0180,"In addition, most forecasts of inflation, as summarized by both Blue Chip and the SPF, show a gradual rise in inflation over the next year, not a decline.","External forecasts show gradual inflation rise, not decline",Consensus forecasts of rising inflation support the view that additional accommodation is not needed
CODE_Inflation_0181,"Blessed with a combination of positive supply shocks and supply-enhancing structural changes, monetary policy is the critical factor shaping how the benefits of these developments are shared between higher output and lower inflation during the expansion and, therefore, how they will affect the underlying trend of inflation beyond this expansion.",Monetary policy is critical for determining inflation outcomes from supply shocks,"Emphasizes monetary policy's critical role in managing inflation outcomes, suggesting active policy management (likely tightening) is needed to ensure favorable supply conditions translate into lower trend inflation."
CODE_Inflation_0182,"Some numbers have gone down, but owners' equivalent rent may come back up a bit. So I don't think we can say that the temporary elevation in that area has passed and that we can move on. I think some challenges are still there.",Owners' equivalent rent component may increase and temporary elevation in inflation hasn't fully passed,The forecast that owners' equivalent rent may increase and that temporary inflation elevation hasn't passed suggests ongoing inflation risks that would warrant continued restrictive policy vigilance.
CODE_Inflation_0183,"I have been worried for some time, and I am becoming increasingly worried, about the disjuncture between the Main Street view of inflation and the Wall Street view of inflation. If it is a fact, the implication is that real interest rates look a lot higher on Main Street than they do on Wall Street, and we should be mindful of that. If that hypothesis is correct, that's likely to mean that there is more punch in what we have already done than we realize.",Concern about disjuncture between Main Street and Wall Street views of inflation and its policy implications,The possibility that previous policy tightening has more impact than realized due to inflation perception differences suggests less additional tightening may be needed
CODE_Inflation_0184,"With respect to inflation, I continue to become less worried that inflation will remain persistently below 2 percent. This reflects several factors. First, the trend of core inflation has flattened out despite the damping effect of lower oil prices and a firmer dollar—influences that will likely prove to be transitory.",Speaker is becoming less worried about inflation remaining persistently below 2% due to transitory dampening factors,"The speaker's reduced concern about persistently low inflation and expectation that disinflationary forces are transitory suggests inflation will move toward target, supporting the case for less accommodative policy or rate increases."
CODE_Inflation_0185,"Inflation appears to be firming, and I believe it will approach the Committee's target by year-end.",Inflation is currently firming and will approach target by year-end,Current firming of inflation combined with expectation of reaching target supports the argument for abandoning current forward guidance and moving toward less accommodative policy.
CODE_Inflation_0186,"If we assume that the economy is on a satisfactory path now, a gliding path toward some notion of its capacity and inflation is not accelerating and later we find out we were wrong, that is a very costly thing to correct.",Policy mistakes assuming satisfactory inflation path are costly to correct,"This argument about asymmetric policy risks suggests that being too optimistic about the inflation outlook and being wrong would be more costly than being too cautious, supporting preemptive tightening of monetary policy."
CODE_Inflation_0187,"Employment is expected to pick up, although at a painfully slow pace. And inflation is expected to accelerate gradually.",Expects gradual inflation acceleration,Expectation of gradual inflation acceleration argues against the need for additional accommodation
CODE_Inflation_0188,"The two factors that we know are distorting inflation readings, the exchange value of the dollar and the price of oil, seem to have stabilized for now.",Assessment that temporary disinflationary factors have stabilized,"Stabilization of factors that were distorting inflation downward suggests these temporary headwinds are abating, reducing the need for continued accommodation and supporting policy tightening."
CODE_Inflation_0189,"Bond yields, however, suggest that inflation expectations remain very low, and wage gains, generally speaking, remain limited.",Inflation expectations remain at the low end of historical ranges with limited wage gains,"Low inflation expectations and limited wage growth indicate weak inflationary pressures, supporting continued monetary accommodation"
CODE_Inflation_0190,I am concerned about the inflation developments and I'm not sure that they're all attributable to organized labor.,Current inflation developments are concerning and not entirely attributable to organized labor,The speaker's concern about current inflation developments and identification of causes beyond organized labor suggests inflationary pressures warrant restrictive monetary policy response.
CODE_Inflation_0191,"I do see several upside risks to inflation: the high level of total headline inflation, which could erode inflation expectations; business resistance to any erosion of profit margins as unit labor costs pick up; the high levels of resource utilization in the United States; and the tighter global conditions of demand on potential supply","Multiple upside risks to inflation from high headline inflation, resource utilization, and global demand pressures","Identifies multiple channels through which inflation could rise, suggesting need for vigilant or potentially more restrictive monetary policy"
CODE_Inflation_0192,"How well will we take advantage of the extraordinary disinflationary forces during this expansion, given the staff forecast or my slightly more pessimistic scenario, in order to lower the underlying inflation trend going forward?",Desire to use disinflationary forces to lower underlying inflation trend,"Expresses preference for using current favorable conditions to achieve a lower underlying inflation trend, which would require restrictive policy to prevent the opportunity from being wasted."
CODE_Inflation_0193,"However, I continue to worry that my forecast of inflation is overly optimistic. And that implies a cautious, data-dependent approach to any further policy tightening next year.","Concern that inflation forecast may be overly optimistic, implying need for caution",Uncertainty about inflation forecasts and worry about being too optimistic suggests a more cautious approach to further policy tightening
CODE_Inflation_0194,And we had better act now if we're worried about inflation in '95.,Need for preemptive action to prevent inflation in 1995,The warning about inflation risks in 1995 and the need for immediate action reflects concern about future inflation pressures and supports preemptive monetary tightening to prevent inflation from emerging given the long lags in monetary policy transmission.
CODE_Inflation_0195,"Just quickly on inflation—most people have said that we've seen some moderation. It is a little too soon to declare victory. As we said in the initial briefing, when we drill down into the components and look at owners' equivalent rent, we may get some nasty surprises going forward.","Recent inflation has shown welcome moderation, but it's too early to declare victory and there may be nasty surprises ahead in owners' equivalent rent","The speaker's caution against declaring victory over inflation despite recent moderation suggests continued vigilance is needed, supporting a restrictive monetary policy stance to ensure inflation remains contained."
CODE_Inflation_0196,"Our regional data give little indication that sustained deflation is a risk. Our October survey showed a sharp rise in the number of manufacturers reporting higher input costs, and they expect higher costs to continue over the next six months.",Regional data indicate little deflation risk with rising input costs expected,Low deflation risk and expected rising costs argue against the need for additional monetary accommodation
CODE_Inflation_0197,"Although I indicated in my report at our last meeting that we could see stronger pass-through of energy prices, I was not hearing that from my business contacts in their reports this time around. In fact, many of them said that the energy and commodity price shocks that we've experienced in the past two years could move through our economy without elevating core inflation rates.",Energy and commodity price shocks can pass through the economy without elevating core inflation,"Limited pass-through of energy shocks to core inflation suggests that recent commodity price increases won't generate broader inflationary pressures, reducing need for restrictive policy"
CODE_Inflation_0198,"While headline PCE inflation has been held down by energy prices, the annualized three-month percent change in core PCE prices was above 2 percent in both June and July.",Core PCE inflation measures show firming above 2 percent in recent months,Evidence of core inflation above target suggests less need for accommodative policy and potential for gradual tightening
CODE_Inflation_0199,"As of the Tealbook, the staff was expecting an increase in core PCE prices of only about 1.3 to 1.4 percent for the 12 months through August, and, on net, the latest CPI and PPI data have done little to change this projection.",Core PCE inflation expected to remain low at 1.3-1.4% through August,Low near-term inflation forecast suggests accommodative monetary policy is appropriate to help move inflation toward the 2% target
CODE_Inflation_0200,"There's a third scenario, which, to me, is very plausible and is essentially some version of the Tealbook baseline: roughly trend growth with stable inflation that is just below 2 percent.",Most plausible scenario involves stable inflation just below 2 percent,Expectation of stable below-target inflation suggests no case for rate hikes and supports accommodative policy stance
CODE_Inflation_0201,"A natural conclusion is that nearly eight years after the end of the recession, the cyclical dynamics of the U.S. economy have played out almost completely, and the economy has settled into a type of near-steady-state outcome, which I'm calling a low-real-rate regime characterized by 2 percent output growth, low unemployment, a low policy rate, and inflation close to target.",Economy has settled into low-real-rate regime with inflation close to target,"The assessment that the economy has reached a steady state with inflation close to target in a low-real-rate regime suggests limited need for significant policy rate increases, supporting a more accommodative stance."
CODE_Inflation_0202,"We are experiencing what looks to be a transitory slowdown in growth, and a transitory bulge in inflation",Current inflation bulge is transitory,Viewing current high inflation as temporary supports not tightening policy in response
CODE_Inflation_0203,I hasten to add that I currently see no signs of labor market overheating or of building inflation pressures.,No current signs of building inflation pressures,Absence of building inflation pressures suggests no urgency for aggressive policy tightening
CODE_Inflation_0204,"It seems to me that if there is any risk in this forecast, it is that we'll get more inflation and a comparable decrease in real growth.",Main forecast risk is higher inflation leading to lower real growth,Identifying upside inflation risk as the primary concern suggests need for vigilant anti-inflationary policy to prevent both higher inflation and the resulting economic damage.
CODE_Inflation_0205,inflation to return to levels below my preferred long-run goal of 2 percent,Inflation expected to return below preferred 2% long-run goal,Expecting inflation below preferred target supports accommodative policy to help achieve desired inflation levels
CODE_Inflation_0206,"Currently, headline inflation is running below target, but I project inflation will return to our 2 percent objective in early 2017.",Projection that inflation will return to 2 percent target in early 2017,Confidence that inflation will return to target within a reasonable timeframe supports tightening monetary policy despite current below-target readings.
CODE_Inflation_0207,"Fortunately, expectations still seem reasonably well contained. But I think that there may be some challenges going forward as the economy continues to grow at least at a moderate pace, and some of the temporary factors are not necessarily completely behind us. We still have to look for potential price pressures going forward.","Inflation expectations are contained but challenges may emerge as economy grows at moderate pace, with temporary factors not completely behind us","The causal link between moderate economic growth and potential price pressures, combined with concerns about temporary factors not being fully resolved, suggests need for continued policy vigilance to prevent inflation from re-emerging."
CODE_Inflation_0208,"The key to the outlook in the context of monetary policy, therefore, is not the blissful state projected for 1999 but the pattern of rising inflation, especially in 2000, and the prospect of further increases thereafter based on the continued labor market tightness at the end of the forecast horizon.",Rising inflation pattern in 2000 should be the key policy focus,"Emphasizes that rising inflation in 2000 should be the primary policy concern, suggesting need for policy adjustment to address this anticipated inflation increase."
CODE_Inflation_0209,"And, as President Rosengren indicated in a recent speech, in the past when the core and trimmed mean PCE inflation measures have diverged, core PCE inflation has tended to move toward the trimmed mean.",Historical pattern suggests core PCE inflation will converge toward trimmed mean measures,Expectation that core inflation will rise toward the 2% trimmed mean suggests less need for accommodative policy
CODE_Inflation_0210,"On inflation, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas trimmed mean PCE inflation rate measured year over year in December 2014 was 1.58 percent; in December 2015, 1.62 percent; in December 2016, 1.84 percent; and in January 2017, 1.87 percent. It's rising, yes, but ever so gently.",Inflation is rising but only gradually based on recent data,"The characterization of inflation as rising ""ever so gently"" suggests that current inflation trends do not warrant aggressive monetary tightening, supporting a more gradual or accommodative approach."
CODE_Inflation_0211,"Some increase was to be expected, given that we are essentially removing some of the downside tail risk through our actions. Importantly, we still remain firmly within the range of recent years.",View that some increase in inflation expectations from QE was expected and acceptable,Justifies QE policies by explaining that modest increases in inflation expectations were an expected and acceptable outcome of removing deflationary risks
CODE_Inflation_0212,"And, third, my own reading is that there is some scope for higher inflation from a firmer trajectory for shelter and health-care costs. As we all know, these components have a significant weight in core inflation measures.",There is scope for higher inflation from firmer trajectory in shelter and health-care costs,"The expectation of higher inflation from key components with significant weight in core measures suggests upward pressure on overall inflation, supporting less accommodative policy."
CODE_Inflation_0213,"Continued above-trend growth should further tighten labor markets and put slight upward pressure on both wages and prices. With recent inflation data coming in on the soft side, I view this additional upward pressure as welcome.","Above-trend growth should create upward price pressure, which is welcome given soft recent inflation","Expects and welcomes upward price pressure from continued strong growth, suggesting tolerance for some tightening effects"
CODE_Inflation_0214,That gets around the question of trying to answer to what extent the recent oil prices affect the forecast of the CPI that is embodied in the TIPS yield.,Recent oil price increases are affecting CPI forecasts embedded in TIPS yields,"Recent oil price increases are pushing up inflation forecasts embedded in market-based measures, which would typically support more restrictive monetary policy to counteract inflationary pressures."
CODE_Inflation_0215,"Maybe inflation fits into the category of an anomaly. I've certainly been more encouraged by the recent news--the fact that in this most recent inflation report the last 12-month core inflation number is lower than the previous 12-month number. So, there is still a possibility of making some progress, but we shouldn't think that the progress is going to be anywhere near as good as it has been in the last year or so.",Recent inflation data shows encouraging improvement with 12-month core inflation declining,Improving inflation data reduces the need for restrictive monetary policy to combat inflation pressures
CODE_Inflation_0216,"In short, to me balance is an accurate reflection of the risks with regard to inflation, and I think the impact on the markets of our stating that is likely to be quite transitory.",Inflation risks are balanced overall,"A balanced risk assessment suggests no immediate need for policy adjustment, supporting maintenance of current accommodative stance rather than preemptive tightening."
CODE_Inflation_0217,"I think, however we look at it, we are looking at a very strong economy. And I don't see that that is going to abate any time soon, and that obviously has implications for policy.",Strong economy expected to continue with implications for monetary policy,"Continued economic strength implies sustained demand pressures that could generate inflation, requiring restrictive monetary policy to prevent overheating"
CODE_Inflation_0218,"It is a little surprising to me that despite this extraordinary job market tightness and widespread expectations that health care costs are going to move up, the Greenbook does not project a further increase in the growth rate of ECI compensation for 1998 over 1997. Unit labor costs in the projection do rise as a result of the weak productivity growth. So, we do get a projected .3 percentage point increase, on a consistently measured basis, in both the core CPI and the core PCE measures of inflation.",Tight labor markets and weak productivity growth will lead to higher inflation,"The speaker identifies a causal chain from tight labor markets and weak productivity to higher unit labor costs and ultimately higher inflation, suggesting restrictive policy may be needed to address these pressures."
CODE_Inflation_0219,"I don't see the possibility of a big outbreak of inflation. The usual indicia are simply not present: We don't see an overheated economy; cost-push pressures aren't significant, if you look at the slack in labor markets; we're not importing inflation; people aren't rushing to convert to real assets. So, I'm a little more encouraged on inflation.",Risk of significant inflation outbreak is low due to absence of typical warning indicators,Low inflation risk reduces the urgency for preemptive tightening and supports maintaining accommodative policy
CODE_Inflation_0220,"I also support ""B"" symmetric. I think the economy has been weaker than we previously thought. Inflation is better and we could declare victory.",Current inflation performance is satisfactory enough to declare victory,Viewing current inflation as satisfactory supports symmetric policy stance rather than maintaining anti-inflation bias
CODE_Inflation_0221,"If I put all of this together, I see more downside than upside risk on inflation, and this is something I'll be watching in the months ahead.",More downside than upside risks to inflation outlook,Asymmetric downside risks to inflation support more accommodative policy to guard against undershooting the target
CODE_Inflation_0222,"However, our latest survey of Michigan retailers indicates that they plan to raise prices over the next three months and most purchasing managers around the District continue to report paying higher prices for their inputs.",Retailers planning price increases and input costs rising,Forward-looking indicators of price increases and rising input costs suggest emerging inflationary pressures that may warrant restrictive policy action.
CODE_Inflation_0223,"As I look at the kinds of things we would identify as inflation shocks—where the effects should be about worn off—they are almost all in the same direction. Some examples, obviously, are fuel, commodity prices, health care costs, property and liability insurance—a lot of companies talk about that now—and security costs. All of these are shocks, and they may be about worn off. But the fact is that they are all shocks in the same direction; I don't know of any for which the prices are moving down. So I think we should not ignore the possibility that we have an inflation environment that's gradually going to be turning more adverse.","Multiple inflation shocks are all moving in the same upward direction, suggesting a gradually more adverse inflation environment","The pattern of unidirectional upward price shocks suggests building inflationary pressure that could become entrenched, warranting preemptive restrictive policy to prevent a more adverse inflation environment."
CODE_Inflation_0224,"One reason for our marginally greater optimism is that real GDP is estimated to have grown only 1.4 percent last year. Obviously, there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding that estimate, but our analysis indicates that the output gap was about nil prior to 1995 and if our estimate of potential output is accurate, some slack has built up in the aggregate economy, which should reduce the likelihood that inflation will accelerate this year.",Economic slack from slow GDP growth reduces likelihood of inflation acceleration,"The argument that economic slack reduces inflation risk provides justification for maintaining accommodative policy, as there is less pressure for preemptive tightening to prevent inflation"
CODE_Inflation_0225,"He also said that prices for general merchandise are falling at a rate of about 1 percent, but they had been falling at a rate of about 3½ percent. So, price changes are still negative, on average, but not by as much as before.",General merchandise prices are still falling but at a slower rate than before,"While prices are still declining, the slower rate of decline suggests diminishing disinflationary pressure, but current negative price changes still support accommodative policy."
CODE_Inflation_0226,"On the inflation front, we're also closer to our target. As mentioned, year-over-year PCE inflation has risen from about 1 percent last December to 1.8 percent now. Other measures—including medians, trimmed means, and other indicators—also suggest we are moving closer to our goal.",Substantial progress has been made toward the inflation target,The significant rise in inflation from 1% to 1.8% and progress across multiple measures indicates the Committee should acknowledge this progress by adjusting policy toward less accommodation.
CODE_Inflation_0227,The risk of a real weakening of inflation expectations has not materialized. Survey measures are stable. Longer-term breakevens have climbed above their lows of earlier this year as spot oil prices have increased.,Assessment that inflation expectations remain stable and market-based measures have improved,"Well-anchored inflation expectations and improving market-based measures reduce concerns about deflationary risks, supporting the case for policy normalization rather than continued accommodation."
CODE_Inflation_0228,"I continue to anticipate inflation will gradually return to our target because I expect output growth to be above trend, labor markets to continue their strengthening, and inflation expectations to remain stable.","Causal explanation that above-trend growth, labor market strengthening, and stable expectations will drive inflation return",The causal mechanism linking strong growth and tight labor markets to inflation return provides fundamental support for policy tightening.
CODE_Inflation_0229,"On that score, I worry that there could be a lot of downside risk to inflation from that. If really bad things happen, which I think unfortunately is a seriously possibility, inflation could fall. A key fact, by the way, is that if you look at past recessions, you do find that inflation falls in the 12 months after recessions. In a couple of cases with supply shocks, there was a rise in inflation at the beginning of the recessions. Seven out of eight are in that category. Particularly if it's a severe recession, it's much more likely for inflation to fall.",Severe recession could cause inflation to fall based on historical patterns,"Historical evidence that severe recessions lead to falling inflation supports accommodative policy to prevent deflationary outcomes, especially given the risk of a severe recession."
CODE_Inflation_0230,"Fortunately, the output and productivity data that we've received since that meeting have been on the upside, and the inflation news has been generally encouraging.",Recent inflation developments have been encouraging,"Encouraging inflation news suggests inflationary pressures are contained, reducing the need for restrictive monetary policy"
CODE_Inflation_0231,The only caveat to this is the mixed readings that we have had on longer-run inflation expectations since our July meeting.,Recent softening in longer-run inflation expectations is concerning,Concerns about declining inflation expectations support maintaining accommodative policy to anchor expectations
CODE_Inflation_0232,"As I mentioned yesterday, an upturn in owners' equivalent rent could be coming. There could be some uncertainty about pass-through to core of the higher energy prices that we have been seeing. There is continued strong world demand, and there could be some lagged pass-through effects of the previous declines in the dollar. I see all those as risks to the upside, and so I think it's important to convey that we are still concerned about those things.","Multiple upside inflation risks exist including owners' equivalent rent upturn, energy price pass-through, strong world demand, and lagged dollar decline effects","The identification of multiple specific causal channels for upside inflation risks (housing costs, energy pass-through, global demand, currency effects) supports a restrictive policy stance to guard against these potential inflationary pressures."
CODE_Inflation_0233,"I recognize that we will have some explanations to make when we move to tighten policy because, while inflation pressures are building, there also are low inflation numbers and low inflation expectations.",Building inflation pressures despite currently low inflation readings,"The speaker acknowledges that despite current low inflation, underlying pressures are building, which justifies tightening policy preemptively even though it may be difficult to communicate given current low readings."
CODE_Inflation_0234,"We basically would allow inflation to move up gradually, as it's expected to do, even though it would take a bit longer to get there.",Policy should allow gradual inflation increase without deliberate action to inflate further,Preference for patient approach to inflation suggests avoiding additional rate cuts and allowing natural firming process
CODE_Inflation_0235,"Consequently, and as emphasized by several participants at the previous meeting and at this meeting, it is possible that the public's expectations are starting to settle on the 2 percent objective being a ceiling rather than a midpoint.",Concern that public expectations may be anchoring on 2% as a ceiling rather than midpoint,"If expectations anchor below the symmetric 2% target, this could require more accommodative policy to achieve the inflation objective and prevent a structural downward shift in inflation expectations"
CODE_Inflation_0236,"It's not surprising, therefore, that in the ranking of inflation fighters we find ourselves near the bottom of the scale, as the Redbook among other things shows.",Federal Reserve has poor reputation as inflation fighter compared to other central banks,Poor credibility as inflation fighter suggests need for tighter monetary policy to restore reputation and effectiveness
CODE_Inflation_0237,"What our model, and interpretations of it, would tend to indicate is that trying to respond to the short-term weakness that shows up with very strong money growth here would have very little effect in the short run; really a lot of it would pass through into prices looking out into late 1988 and early 1989.",Strong money growth would pass through into higher prices with little short-term real effect,"This argument against accommodative policy (strong money growth) suggests it would be ineffective for real growth but would lead to higher inflation, supporting a more restrictive stance."
CODE_Inflation_0238,But I think it does push against the notion that there's compelling evidence that substantial risk to the downside in terms of inflation expectations are emerging. I just don't think the data really support that conclusion.,No compelling evidence that substantial downside risks to inflation expectations are emerging,"The conclusion that substantial downside risks to inflation expectations are not emerging reduces the case for maintaining highly accommodative policy, supporting a more restrictive stance."
CODE_Inflation_0239,"Every council member expects inflation to accelerate noticeably over the next 12 months, the consequence of tight labor markets and GDP growth consistently above its trend rate.",Inflation expected to accelerate noticeably due to tight labor markets and above-trend GDP growth,Forecasting noticeable inflation acceleration due to tight economic conditions strongly supports monetary policy tightening
CODE_Inflation_0240,what we see in our own forecast is that at best we have to look forward to a period of a very slow deceleration of inflation. I think that will be regarded as unsatisfactory.,Forecast shows only very slow deceleration of inflation which will be unsatisfactory,Unsatisfactory inflation outlook suggests current policy is inadequate and tighter policy is needed
CODE_Inflation_0241,"For instance, I note that the Tealbook—of course, not everyone agrees with the Tealbook—has inflation about 1.5 percent out through 2016. I doubt very much that you can construct a balanced approach, which means weight on both sides of the objective of the dual mandate, that would give you that kind of result.",The Tealbook projection of 1.5% inflation through 2016 is inconsistent with a balanced dual mandate approach,Criticism of persistent below-target inflation projections implies need for more accommodative policy to achieve balanced approach to dual mandate
CODE_Inflation_0242,"Despite the overall strength in the economy, wage and price pressures remain subdued; we have seen only spotty movements in prices.",Current wage and price pressures remain subdued with only spotty price movements observed,"Subdued price pressures suggest inflationary concerns are limited, reducing the need for restrictive monetary policy to combat inflation"
CODE_Inflation_0243,"Regarding inflationary pressures, I think we should realize, maybe more than we do, how concentrated the industrial pressures are in the United States right now. There are lots of stories coming out of the manufacturing core of the economy about tight markets, very strong capacity utilization, strong order books, good sales, etc. They are all true. But they are very much concentrated in durables manufacturing, which in round numbers is 10 to 12 percent of value added in the U.S. economy.",Assessment that inflationary pressures are concentrated in specific industrial sectors rather than broad-based,"The concentration of inflationary pressures in a small sector suggests broad monetary tightening may not be necessary, supporting a more accommodative stance"
CODE_Inflation_0244,"the story in the first half of this year was a sizable bump-up in headline inflation, and the second-half story may well be falling oil prices and an undershooting of headline inflation",Current inflation surge is transitory and will decline in second half of year,Expecting inflation to decline supports maintaining accommodative policy rather than tightening in response to current high inflation
CODE_Inflation_0245,"Indeed, although the latest decline in energy prices was not anticipated, inflation dynamics have played out as the Committee suggested they would. In particular, the effects on inflation of last summer's decline in oil prices and drop in import prices were transitory, as expected.",Assessment that oil and import price effects on inflation were transitory as expected,Validation that temporary factors affecting inflation behaved as predicted increases confidence in the inflation outlook and supports policy normalization.
CODE_Inflation_0246,"So it's not true that there's just upside risk; there is downside risk as well, and that's one reason that inflation uncertainty is not an issue just of potential upside. In fact, in the 2003 episode that President Lacker mentioned, the reason there was such a sharp rise in inflation compensation was not that people worried about inflation going up but that they worried that inflation would go down.","Inflation risks are two-sided, not just upside","Recognition of significant downside risks to inflation, including historical precedent of deflation concerns, supports accommodative policy to prevent deflationary outcomes."
CODE_Inflation_0247,I think everybody knows from my comments over a long period of time that I've felt just as strongly as Jerry and others about the long-run inflationary risks,Strong concern about long-run inflationary risks,"The speaker's expressed concern about long-run inflationary risks indicates a preference for policies that would contain inflation, supporting a restrictive monetary policy stance."
CODE_Inflation_0248,"As you all know, despite the Committee's policy efforts, inflation has averaged well below 2 percent for a protracted period. Our forecasts, too, tend to have inflation returning to our target from below, with relatively little overshoot.",Inflation has persistently undershot the 2% target for an extended period,Persistent below-target inflation performance suggests monetary policy may need to remain accommodative to achieve the inflation objective
CODE_Inflation_0249,"I wrote down 1.9 for year three, and I might prefer something a little lower over time. But given the starting place, I thought the welfare benefits of going down to 1.8 or 1.7 or even 1.6 or 1.5 were less than the welfare costs of the potential unemployment that we would incur doing that.",Preference for maintaining current inflation level rather than pursuing lower inflation due to unemployment costs,Suggests avoiding overly restrictive policy that would push inflation significantly below current levels due to employment costs
CODE_Inflation_0250,"Retailers tell me that they've trained their customers to shop for bargains only too well. Consumers are relentless in their hunt for bargains, and Internet shopping is growing rapidly in popularity and making that hunt for bargains easier.",Consumer bargain hunting behavior creates downward pressure on prices,"Consumer behavior that drives down prices suggests disinflationary forces are at work, reducing the need for restrictive policy"
CODE_Inflation_0251,"Finally in terms of the [national] forecast, I would say our forecast is quite a bit different in the sense that we are looking for much slower real growth and modestly higher inflation than the central tendency.",Forecast of modestly higher inflation than the central tendency,The speaker's forecast of higher inflation than consensus suggests inflationary pressures that would warrant restrictive monetary policy to contain price increases.
CODE_Inflation_0252,"Despite the soft economic conditions, the most prominent concern that we have heard from our business contacts across a variety of industries is the run-up in commodity prices and other prices. Thus far, firms have resisted passing along their rising costs to customers, to the extent that they could, but many firms tell us that they have gone as far as they can on holding the line on their own prices and plan to raise prices further in the next few months.",Business contacts report building price pressures with firms planning to raise prices in coming months,"This cyclical forecast of near-term price increases suggests inflationary pressures are building, supporting the need for tighter monetary policy to contain inflation."
CODE_Inflation_0253,"Long-term inflation expectations have been volatile but have moved within a reasonably defined range over the last period, and I'm comforted somewhat by that. But as I have said, I believe that inflation expectations are fragile.",Inflation expectations are fragile despite remaining in tolerable range,This assessment of fragile inflation expectations suggests the need for careful policy action to maintain their anchoring.
CODE_Inflation_0254,"Obviously, if compensation moves up more strongly than the staff is expecting, that would compound any upward push on prices emanating from labor markets.",Higher compensation growth would compound upward price pressures from labor markets,"The speaker warns that stronger wage growth would amplify inflationary pressures from tight labor markets, suggesting the need for restrictive policy to prevent such a scenario from materializing."
CODE_Inflation_0255,"More recently, and I think more salient for this current year that we face, their analysis shows that uncertainty subtracted a few tenths from job growth—even though it was strong, it could have been stronger—and inflation for the past year.",Recent uncertainty has subtracted from inflation over the past year,"Recent uncertainty has held back inflation, suggesting policy should be more accommodative to offset these disinflationary pressures"
CODE_Inflation_0256,Incoming inflation data confirm a trend of moderate inflation pressures.,National inflation data confirm moderate inflation pressures,Moderate inflation pressures suggest monetary policy can be eased without creating excessive inflationary risks
CODE_Inflation_0257,"I think that certainly can be an indication of some reduction in inflation expectations, presumably on the grounds that slower growth will reduce the pressures on resource utilization and hence on cost and prices going forward.",Slower economic growth will reduce inflation expectations and price pressures through reduced resource utilization,"The speaker argues that slower growth will reduce inflationary pressures by decreasing resource utilization, which would support more accommodative monetary policy as inflation risks diminish."
CODE_Inflation_0258,"With the economy slightly tighter, I've got inflation getting to 2 percent by 2017.",Forecast that inflation will reach 2% target by 2017 with tighter economic conditions,"The speaker forecasts inflation will reach the 2% target by 2017 with a tighter economy, suggesting economic conditions support policy normalization and rate increases."
CODE_Inflation_0259,"Talking about wage inflation, the 3.4 percent increase in average hourly earnings was a welcome, high ""print"" for this cycle. But it's entirely consistent with underlying estimates of trend productivity growth and underlying inflation and, as of now, provides no indication of cost-push pressures.",Current wage growth shows no cost-push inflation pressures,Absence of cost-push inflation pressures despite wage growth supports maintaining accommodative policy rather than preemptive tightening
CODE_Inflation_0260,"Concerns about commodity prices, particularly reports of what businesses are saying—and there was a lot of this in 2005 and 2008—read like this: ""Man, we have just shifted. We are now thinking in inflationary terms."" And of course, about six months later they weren't.","Business reports of shifting to ""inflationary thinking"" have historically proven temporary and unreliable","Historical evidence suggests business inflation expectations during commodity price spikes are often temporary, supporting a patient approach that doesn't overreact to current inflation concerns."
CODE_Inflation_0261,"The recent pattern of higher inflation and softer spending seems remarkably similar to the developments we witnessed late last spring and early summer—then, as now, after a spike in energy prices.",Current inflation pattern is similar to past energy-driven episodes,"Suggests current inflation is cyclical and temporary like past energy-driven episodes, implying less aggressive policy response needed"
CODE_Inflation_0262,"First, the nominal funds rate has been at a constant level, but expectations of inflation have risen. So, in fact, the real funds rate has actually declined since our last meeting as inflation has risen.","Policy has become more accommodative as inflation expectations rose, lowering real rates","This describes how policy has inadvertently become more accommodative, suggesting the need to adjust policy to offset this effect."
CODE_Inflation_0263,"So, I think the capacity problem may be more of a constraint than indicated and, therefore, I would say that the real growth would probably be in the 3-1/2 to 3-3/4 area but my price concerns would be higher. I'd be in the 8 to 8-1/2 percent area [with] everybody starting to raise [prices] in view of the real certainty they feel that price controls are around the corner.",Inflation forecast of 8-8.5% with higher price concerns due to capacity constraints and price control expectations,A forecast of 8-8.5% inflation with higher price concerns suggests significant inflationary pressures that would warrant restrictive monetary policy to contain inflation.
CODE_Inflation_0264,"The other element is the inflation outlook, and I think that inflation should remain relatively modest.",Forecast that inflation will remain relatively modest going forward,"A forecast of modest inflation reduces concerns about inflationary pressures, supporting the case for accommodative monetary policy as it suggests room for rate cuts without risking excessive inflation."
CODE_Inflation_0265,"Now, in terms of inflation—and I'll finish with inflation—I'm increasingly worried about achieving our 2 percent objective on a sustained basis, and several factors inform my view.",Increasingly worried about achieving 2% inflation target on a sustained basis,Concern about missing the inflation target supports more accommodative policy to help achieve the 2% objective
CODE_Inflation_0266,"Look, [we will act] if we see evidence that that's true, which we haven't seen heretofore with the weights, trends, and a lot of other things. But we recognize all those dangers.","Current assessment that inflationary pressures haven't been seen yet, but readiness to act if they emerge","While current inflation pressures are not concerning, expresses readiness to tighten policy if inflationary evidence emerges"
CODE_Inflation_0267,The impact on real growth in 1992 is very substantial; it adds more than a percent to growth and adds about 0.3 of a percent to inflation.,Dollar decline scenario would add 0.3 percentage points to inflation in 1992,"If dollar weakness materializes, the resulting inflationary pressure would argue for less accommodative or more restrictive policy"
CODE_Inflation_0268,So the staff's forecast says that we have not lowered the underlying inflation rate at all.,Disappointment that underlying inflation rate hasn't been lowered despite favorable conditions,"Implies disappointment with lack of progress on lowering trend inflation, suggesting need for different (more restrictive) policy approach to achieve this goal."
CODE_Inflation_0269,"On the inflation side, I am not as optimistic as the Greenbook. While we are reasonably confident that inflation will be capped at the 3 or 3-1/4 percent level, I do not expect core inflation to move much below 3 percent, if at all.",Inflation forecast to remain elevated around 3-3.25% with core inflation unlikely to decline much below 3%,Persistent elevated inflation around 3% suggests the need for restrictive monetary policy to prevent inflation from becoming entrenched at undesirable levels
CODE_Inflation_0270,"Despite the series of positive surprises that President Stern pointed out yesterday, since March the center of gravity of expectations around this table is for a slow recovery—maybe a little faster than the Greenbook but not much—and damped inflation.",FOMC consensus expects damped inflation alongside slow recovery,Committee consensus on damped inflation expectations supports maintaining accommodative policy stance
CODE_Inflation_0271,"I think we're going to find it impossible to raise our targets after we've had, say, a 16-1/2 percent increase in the CPI in the first quarter.",Very high CPI numbers will make it politically impossible to raise monetary targets,"Recognition that extremely high inflation will create political pressure against loosening monetary policy, effectively constraining policy toward maintaining or increasing restrictiveness."
CODE_Inflation_0272,"With respect to the TIPS ten-year rate, the oil price has had a very unusual effect on it over the years, and one of the reasons is that the spread of the crude oil seven-year futures has behaved rather differently relative to the spot price in recent years than it had previously.",Structural changes in oil futures markets are affecting TIPS-based inflation measures,"This structural change in how oil markets affect inflation measures suggests the need for more careful interpretation of inflation signals, which could support more cautious or restrictive policy until these effects are better understood."
CODE_Inflation_0273,"Under these circumstances, core PCE inflation holds in the neighborhood of 2 percent. I do not really see much to push it one way or another at this point.",Core PCE inflation is expected to remain around 2 percent with limited factors to push it significantly in either direction,Suggests current monetary policy stance is appropriate as inflation is expected to remain stable near target
CODE_Inflation_0274,I do see a somewhat faster decline in the unemployment rate and a faster acceleration in inflation than in the Tealbook.,Personal forecast shows faster inflation acceleration than Tealbook,Expecting faster inflation acceleration than the staff forecast argues against the need for additional accommodation
CODE_Inflation_0275,Incoming data indicate that the labor market continues to tighten and that inflation appears to be bottoming out.,Inflation appears to be bottoming out,Assessment that inflation is bottoming out supports proceeding with rate increases
CODE_Inflation_0276,"With most measures of the economy still operating at or above capacity and likely to do so for some time, I think the fundamentals indicate that price pressures will remain firm.",Economy operating at or above capacity will keep price pressures firm,The causal link between above-capacity operations and firm price pressures suggests restrictive policy may be needed to cool the economy and reduce inflationary pressures
CODE_Inflation_0277,"if you look at the six-month annualized rate of PCE inflation, it has moved from negative readings early this year to over 2 percent in July. Six-month core PCE inflation increased from less than 1 percent earlier this year to 1.7 percent in July, and a similar pattern is seen in the CPI, core CPI, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas trimmed mean PCE, the Cleveland Fed median CPI, and the Cleveland Fed trimmed mean CPI. The six-month annualized change in all of these measures as of July is 2 percent or more.",Documentation of recent broad-based inflation measures rising to 2 percent or more,Recent broad-based improvement in inflation measures to target levels or above provides strong evidence supporting monetary policy tightening.
CODE_Inflation_0278,"The place where it has the most validity, however, is exactly where the pressures are right now--in business fixed investment, where over 40 percent is imported, and consumer durables where I don't remember the fraction that is imported. Those are precisely the sectors where we are seeing pressure. It is in this very limited part of the economy where the international safety valve is most important.",Recognition that international safety valve is most effective in sectors currently experiencing pressure,The fact that international capacity can help restrain inflation in the specific sectors experiencing pressure reduces the need for broad monetary tightening
CODE_Inflation_0279,"Given the limited pass-through of energy and commodity prices into core prices, I would not expect much downward pressure on inflation from a leveling-out of those prices.",Limited pass-through from energy and commodity prices to core inflation reduces expected disinflationary pressure,"Suggests less natural disinflationary pressure than might be expected, potentially requiring more restrictive policy to control inflation"
CODE_Inflation_0280,"And because we're falling short of our inflation objective, it seems appropriate that real interest rates be set below that level.",Real interest rates should be set below neutral level given inflation shortfall,Explicitly argues for accommodative policy (real rates below neutral) as appropriate response to inflation shortfall
CODE_Inflation_0281,"One might think that if r* were near its 2 percent longer-run value in the Tealbook and the Committee's modal SEP projections, a near zero real funds rate in 2016 as the economy is approaching full employment would cause a substantial undershoot by unemployment of its natural rate and an eventual overshoot of our 2 percent inflation objective. But there are no such under- and overshoots in the Tealbook baseline.",Low real rates in 2016 won't cause inflation overshoot due to economic conditions,"Explains why accommodative policy won't lead to inflation overshooting, supporting continued low rates even as economy approaches full employment"
CODE_Inflation_0282,"Don't forget, we're going to have a first- quarter CPI number that's possibly going to scoop the markets right out of their minds again.",First quarter CPI increase will be extremely high and shock financial markets,"Expecting shocking high inflation numbers suggests markets will demand more aggressive anti-inflationary policy response, supporting restrictive monetary policy."
CODE_Inflation_0283,The second is that inflation might take longer than we anticipate to reach 2 percent on a sustained basis.,Risk that inflation takes longer than anticipated to reach 2%,Risk of delayed inflation recovery suggests caution in removing accommodation too quickly
CODE_Inflation_0284,"Also disturbing is that we certainly have had a big increase in long-run inflation uncertainty. That's reflected not only in terms of inflation compensation but also in the fact that people are buying inflation caps, TIPS are becoming very popular, and so forth and so on.",Long-run inflation uncertainty has increased significantly,"Increased long-run inflation uncertainty suggests less anchored expectations, which could lead to higher and more volatile inflation, calling for more cautious monetary policy."
CODE_Inflation_0285,"Market risk-taking in an environment of very accommodative policy, combined with what likely is a bottoming out—or probably a turning up at least in the near term—of the path for inflation, seems to me to argue that we ought to start closing the interest rate gap fairly soon.",Inflation likely bottoming out and turning upward,"The forecast that inflation is bottoming out and may turn upward, combined with very accommodative policy creating market risks, provides a strong argument for beginning to raise interest rates soon."
CODE_Inflation_0286,"Well, I'm not sure I share this view—and I'm channeling President Mester a bit here, I think—because the size of these changes is not that large. It's on the order of 15 to 25 basis points.",Disagrees with Tealbook assessment that declining inflation expectations pose substantial downside risks,"The disagreement with concerns about declining inflation expectations suggests less need for accommodative policy to address expectation risks, supporting a more restrictive stance."
CODE_Inflation_0287,"In fact, in my view, the next move in underlying inflation is more likely to be down than up.",Inflation is more likely to decline than increase going forward,Expectation that inflation will more likely fall than rise supports continued accommodative policy to prevent deflationary pressures
CODE_Inflation_0288,If I am right that an inflation rate of 4 percent in the GNP deflator means something close to 5 percent on the CPI--and that is the middle of the range--your number means the CPI could be over 5 percent.,Belief that CPI inflation could exceed 5 percent based on GNP deflator projections,CPI inflation over 5% would be concerning and suggest need for tighter monetary policy to bring inflation under control
CODE_Inflation_0289,"Concerns about pricing power remain, but some firms do seem to believe that cost increases can be passed on.",Firms gaining ability to pass through cost increases,"Improving pricing power indicates that firms are gaining ability to raise prices, suggesting inflationary pressures may intensify and supporting the case for tighter monetary policy."
